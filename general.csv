"softness and comfort and a GREAT fit. Briefs may be too ""old-fashioned"" for some younger girls"	 but us REAL WOMEN know what counts! |||1
very comfy and very big I got a size 6	 and wow that is the biggest 6 I've even seen but what ya gonna do? LOL. |||1
I ordered the size to match the measurements on the chart	" but they arrived much too big. The ""height"" on these is pretty crazy.- If you are looking for Granny |||1
panties that go up to your bra	 these may be for you.- If you are looking for normal briefs that don't encompass you're entire mid-section you should look elsewhere. |||1
These panties are cut like other Fruit of the Loom briefs. The sizing is the same asFruit of the Loom Women's 6-Pack Heather Briefswhich I've ordered several times. But	 unlike |||1
the Heather briefs	" these ""Body Tone"" briefs have no lining in the crotch area. I've purchased Fruit of the Looms for years"	 and these are the first briefs that lacked |||1
a lining.The product description cays that colors will vary. My package contained 2 pink	 2 beige	 1 cranberry	 and 1 black brief. Because they're not lined	 I wouldn't buy these |||1
again. |||1
I ordered these for my monthly accidents if needed. I wish the whole package was black but they do the job. |||1
I am not a fan of going to the store so the convenience of ordering these online far outweighed my need to do more laundry. |||1
Fits well in the waist but the fit is a little loose everywhere else. The material is cool and comfortable	 and overall good for the price. |||1
Don't last very long. I was disappointed in that |||1
Was pleased with fast delivery and quality of these briefs.They fit perfect true to size accordingly as ad mentioned.Was well did not fade	 kept it's shape which was veryImportant to |||1
Me. Packaged Nicely in One package too. |||1
I am a big fan of fruit of the loom products	 and this one did not disappoint. The fit was great. |||1
I wear a size 16 slacks and the size 7 Fruit of the Loom are a great fit	 comfortable and non-clingy. I liked the choice of colors in the package; |||1
I often find bawdy prints	 bright colors	 or all white	 which I don't like. I would love packs of all black	 but this variety will work just fine.Fruit of the |||1
Loom continues to give affordable and well made products. The cotton is soft and feels nice against your body	 even in hot and humid Florida temps!! I think it's time |||1
to get rid of all my old panties and stock up with Fruit of the Loom ones... |||1
I have quite a few of these panties and every one of them have been ripped at the waits band. They are comfy but I don't like how shabby they |||1
are at the waist. They need a better waistband. The Hanes NO RIDE UP are better. |||1
I bought this for a relative and she loved the fit and the comfort of the underwear. They seem durable and come in a good variety of colors to match |||1
any outfit. |||1
These briefs are quite comfortable and of good quality and the price is excellent so I would highly recommend them to any woman for daily wear. |||1
These fit me okay	 although somehow not quite as well as their competitor's. My main complaint is that you don't get the colors shown in the pic	 and they certainly |||1
"shouldn't be called ""Body Tone"". I ordered two packages that both included 2 light pink"	 1 nude	 and 1 black	 (which were fine) but the other two pairs were a |||1
dark rose that wasn't depicted and I have no use for. Do you know anyone who has naturally dark rose skin? I really wish someone would offer a multi pack |||1
with either all nude or a nude/black assortment. |||1
Ahh	 cotton	 soft	 comfortable and no silly colors. All natural	 neutral comfy bottom covers! Brand new great price!Shipped fast	 would buy again. |||1
I've purchased Fruit of the Loom brief panties before and been very happy with the quality. These	 again	 are good quality but even though I order my usual size	 were |||1
on the small side. |||1
These fit on the small side	 and the material is so thin you can read the newspaper through them. Wish they were made in America! |||1
I think I ordered the wrong size. Just a little big even after washing	 but good material. The price is right and the shipping was fast! Thanks! |||1
The Underwear fit very comfortable	 and are soft on my body skin.I would recommend them for women to wear	everyday. |||1
I love to be comfortable in whatever I wear. These panties are just that.I will be buying more of these soon.A woman should always have more than enough underweare. |||1
I gave this 4 stars because while it was NOT what I intended to buy	 if you're looking for ...um... generously-sized ... full-coverage panties	 THESE ARE THEM! I bought the |||1
same size I buy in a brick&mortar; store	 and these are ~generous~	 as I said.If you're looking for chonies that go up to your ribcage	 you've found them. The only |||1
reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the waistband seems a little scratchy (to the hand--I didn't put them on).The colors are very nice.But they're Gigantopanties. |||1
Full coverage undies. They fit like they are supposed to and cover what they are supposed to. Not sexy by any means but they good underwear. |||1
These are a bit thicker than the bikinis I bought. I like how they fit. They are hi cut briefs and they fit just like the name suggests... cover all |||1
my bottom and sits at or right above my navel. Perfect to lounge around the house in or sleep in. However. if I am going out and wearing a fitted |||1
dress/ skirt/ pants then these panties would not be worn; I can't afford for everyone to see my 'granny panty lines'. But hey	 that's why we have different underwear for |||1
different occasions	 right? I purchased the size 8 and I wear a size 18. The only prob I had with these are the colors. I received 2 of the same |||1
color -2 pink	 2 striped	 2 white (would have preferred a variety of colors). By the way	 can't they go easy on these white panties? Give me darker colors please!!!! |||1
These are an excellent fit and I like how you can buy a package with more than 3 in it. |||1
There just underwear. Fit fine and the price is fine. I would buy again. I feel I got what I paid for. |||1
I wanted to try Fruit of the Loom to see if they were similar to Jockey French Cuts which I love but they are a little expensive because I need |||1
100% cotton on my skin. These were super thin and did not seem like cotton but more polyester. Not the same size fit as Jockey or quality. I'm going back |||1
Jockey's. |||1
Mostly stuck to Hanes brand before	 but no more. I love these Fruit of the Loom undies. Will definitely be buying more. |||1
This panties don't extend or stretch. the fabric is soft	 are easy to wash. Soft and beautiful color. I recomend it |||1
Eh	 they're underwear	 what can I say. They fit as expected and haven't gotten saggy or torn or anything like that. But! I ordered an assorted package and what I |||1
got was a pack of all white panties. Kind of boring	 and not really what I wanted. but regardless of color they do what they need to do. |||1
Son muy buenas	 la calidad y las tallas son acorde con lo que uno pide	 el envio es rapido	 solo me parece que estan un poco costosas. |||1
These panties fit perfectly	 so the size is accurate. They don't ride up	 which is majorly important. The top doesn't roll down...the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars rather |||1
"than 5 is the fact that cotton they're made from is a little rough and scratchy...almost a ""wool"" feeling. They do not itch or irritate or anything of the sort...they |||1
just aren't as soft as I had hoped they'd be. They may soften up with washing & time...but I don't know that yet. Overall	 I like them well enough. I |||1
would buy them again...but if I had my choice they'd be softer...but then	 if they were softer	 they'd likely cost more. |||1
Bought this for a gift	 not for me. But my mom really liked them and the texture is really lightweight and comfortable. |||1
These were way too big	 but it was my own fault for ordering the wrong size! I figured I give them some leeway to shrink	 but they didn't shrink much |||1
at all in the wash...the style in the photo looks better	 though	 they don't seem like they are hi-cut in the legs. I DID find the right style and size |||1
from FOTL just recently...if you order these	 I would just order true to size! Delivery was quick as well! |||1
They have worn and washed well so far. The size was accurate and I haven't noticed much shrinkage. I'll have to wear them awhile before I can form any more |||1
of an opinion but for now	 I'm pleased with them. |||1
These are okay	 a bit tight at the waist and leg. I purchased the right size	 but they run a bit tight. |||1
I love the fit of these. They offer the right amount of coverage without being constricting. They also don't ride up. Great fit at a great price. I can't say |||1
anything more. |||1
These panties were not only too little	 but the material was too thin. A couple of washes and they would be done. I had go give them away to much	 |||1
much	 smaller sister... |||1
Love the colors and prints. Lots of fun. The panties fits beautifully and wash very well. I let them hang dry	 but being cotton they do fine in the dryer |||1
with other lightweight cotton items. Fruit of the Loom has a comfortable waist band that has a soft	" almost ""peached"" inside that's soft against your skin. I'm 5'3"" and 135 |||1
lbs and needed a size 6 for a comfortable fit. They seem very well made and should last a long time. |||1
I've been looking for hi-cut briefs for some time now. I can't seem to find the REALLY high cut ones that I used to get	 but these do come close. |||1
They are true to size and OH so comfortable. I even forget that they're not cut as high as I usually like lol. I'll be purchasing more to replace these |||1
when they wear out! A+Update July 2013: I've had these for over a year	" and I can now say that they are very durable. I purchased these with ""another brand"" |||1
at the same time	 and those have unraveled. Not so with these	 so I will be ordering more to replace the ones that fell apart. I don't know why these |||1
are getting a bad rap. They are really very nice. |||1
Very good buy - soft and nice colors. Perfect fit and very comfortable. So glad I bought these. Great value. |||1
I usually wear a 7 in Hanes	 and from the reviews here	 I went with the size to 8. Mine are a little roomy in the derriere portion. I'm not |||1
sure how the 7 would have fit	 but I'm thinking maybe I should have stuck with the size 7.I noticed on the package they had two size recommendations: 12-14 should |||1
go for a 7	 and 14-16 should move to an 8. So that's kinda putting us size 14 women in two different groups. My recommendation: If you're on the smaller |||1
size of a 14	 go with the 7. |||1
These are comfortable but you may need to wash & run them through the dryer to make them a perfect fit. I don't mind the prints	 solids and whites. |||1
The panties fit fine but I did not receive the colors that are displayed. I got black	 2 white	 navy polka dot on white	 teal green	 and a whimsical floral |||1
pattern. This set would not have been my first choice but it isn't worth sending them back. |||1
The size is not very suitable me. But the quality is great. And I received it very soon after I place the order of it. |||1
they're a bit like granny panties	 almost to my waist....bikini are too low for me though	i guess i have to keep looking..nice material though and i like that |||1
This is a nice six-pack of cotton briefs .They fit well	 don't ride up or bind. The package contains 3 pairs of solid colors and 3 pairs of patterned briefs. |||1
They are very comfortable. |||1
A good product. Comfortable to wear and waist does not extend above jeans.Holds up well to washing. Wasn't able to choose my own colours but the ones that came were |||1
nce enough that I didn't mind. Would buy again. |||1
its cheap for sure !!but the fabric is so so Lightits very comfortablebut gets old quicklyso not that goodthank you |||1
My friend asked me to grab her some underwear while I was online. I just asked her	 she said they were good. It's odd to have underwear conversations. |||1
I wear a size 6 in underwear and these were just that...a size 6. They fit me perfectly and I'd order another set next time of the same kind. I |||1
really like them alot! |||1
My wife says she will tell her friends that they are a good buy.Looking at them on her looked real good.artras@att.net |||1
Nothing special here. A few pairs have not held up in the wash as much as I'd like but other than that	 they serve their purpose. |||1
took size based on makers sizing chart for hips so took a large however its bout 3/4 inch too big 	 they fit but not perfectly 	 material is comfy |||1
and colours nice 	will order size lower next time	 would recommend to friends. |||1
I have purchased this same brand	 style	 and size in stores for years. Sometimes I can't find my size	 so I decided to buy online. I thought I would get |||1
what was represented in the picture: pastel colors and subtle prints. Instead I received garish colors and circus-clown prints. Additionally	 the fabric was very thin	 and the fit was more |||1
like bikini than hipster style. (It did say hipster on the package I received.)No more online underwear shopping for me! |||1
Okay	 the price was right. But I bought a similar cheap 6-pack at Costco that was much better quality. I'll look for a different brand next time. |||1
After two or three washings and air drying	 the elastic no longer was snug on my leg. i can't recommend these panties. |||1
Very cute hipster cut with colorful designs	 very comfortable to wear. They fit fairly well	 just a teensy bit smaller than I expected. Great for women like me with absolutely |||1
NO hips! |||1
These are fine and what I expect from Fruit of the Loom. No selection of color or patterns	 though	 so you get what they give you. I got some funky |||1
patterned undies for a middle aged woman! |||1
Made algon	 but very youthful colors are great	 nothing to do with the measures announced in the sizes are very large. |||1
Love the material and the style. The size 5 is a bit too large for me although I am size small. |||1
I bought these underwear to accommodate my expanding body since I'm currently pregnant. I choose a size large based on my pre-pregnancy measurement	 which were waist: 29 inches and hips: |||1
"41 inches. These measurement fell into the ""large"" bracket. Even after gaining 20 pounds they are still too big. |||1
These fit like I expect hipsters to fit. They seem comfortable enough; however	 if you are soft around the hips then the waist and leg elastics will create a roll |||1
between them. It's not uncomfortable	 but it's not pretty either. |||1
very nice cotton	 fun patterns	 perfect unobtrusive fit	 follows the body during pilates	 yoga	 rowing i'll buy another batch - |||1
I love cotton underwear especially ones that aren't granny panties. So glad I got them. Thank you! They are great! |||1
Fruit of the Loom Women's 6-Pack Cotton Hipster	Assorted	5100% Algodon.Comodidad para uso diario...bajo costo	 tiempo de entrega OK; embalaje de envio conforme.Compra recomendada	 tamano conforme estandares establecidos. |||1
I agree with another reviews the panties received are not as shown. The ones received have cheap quality elastic sewn on the waistband and on the outside of the legs	 |||1
the ones shown have an encased elastic on the leg. The colors were nice and bright but the material was a lower quality. My biggest complaint is that they did |||1
not even cover entire backside	 which is not large by any means. I would not recommend purchasing this style. |||1
I usually like Fruit of the Loom cotton panties but the quality cotton is very poor and the fit is loose because of the poor quality and weight of the |||1
cotton and the elastic band. |||1
Wonky ....... well it almost seems as if the leg holes are larger than they should be but I think the crotch of the panty is actually too narrow. FL |||1
usually fits but these are well.....wonky |||1
The material is pure cotton but not fine cotton	 so it is a bit scratchy. The size is somewhat small. |||1
These fit well. They come in good patterns and colors. Do be warned that you don't have control over the colors you receive	 |||1
What can I say other than these are great underwear for practical women. They are not too low where they slide down the legs of your pants or too high |||1
to make you feel like an ol' lady	 lol. Love em. |||1
They fit well and are very comfortable. For the price they can't be beat. However if you are looking for something sexy	 this isn't for you |||1
Pretty comfortable! I bought it because it's made of cotton. The only thing I don't like is that some of the colors in the batch I got are	 er	 not |||1
flattering - I got a yellow one which just looks so juvenile! So if you are interested	 remember that they come in ASSORTED COLORS. Good luck on what you get! |||1
These are really comfy underwear and they breathe very well. I bought these just after we had my daughter and they didnt cut me or move that much. Would buy |||1
these again! |||1
These panties fit very snug and stay in place. A very great deal for six pairs. The sizing is perfect. Its hard to gauge sometimes with so many companies declaring |||1
size's that are different. These are what they are. |||1
Way to little I didn't think they would b that tiny. Im 5 feet 120 pounds but to little for me. |||1
These were comfortable and cool for the summer. They are basic and good for a quick packing into a weekend bag. |||1
Very comfortable. Don't ride up. Good quality. I am happy with the product for the price. Cute designs also. Thanks. |||1
they don't fit like i thought they would and the band was a little uncomfortable but they are my 2nd fav. |||1
"As they confirmed as my wife ""are comfortable"	 soft	 good material	 the right size	 they are recommending to their friends and family. |||1
The size was right	 the colors are very pretty. good quality. liked the girl very much .. very good price for the package |||1
These comfortable boyshort panties fit great. I love the cotton material	 which breathes easily. They feel and look smooth under fitted pants. You can't go wrong with Fruit of the |||1
Loom! I recommend this product to anyone who wants to feel like they're wearing nothing next to their skin. |||1
I took a chance on these underwear even though the reviews were lukewarm. I have to continue with the theme that these underwear are mediocre. They were a little bigger |||1
than I expected based on the size I ordered and the material is very thin. I think the colors I got were a pink	 maroon	 and the other pair were |||1
turquoise. The elastic is very thin at the waist and overall they are just OK. A very boring pair of underwear. They look much cuter in the picture than in |||1
real life. Just a boring pair of everyday underwear that are a bit loose in fit. I wanted them to be big so that I could wear them to bed |||1
- they are too big and they fall down. My mistake to order up so big. I based the larger size on other pairs of similar underwear that I have |||1
bought in the past but they have spandex in them and these don't as far as I can tell. You don't any patterned pairs like you see in the picture |||1
which I think may give them a bit of pizazz. |||1
the fit of these are off. they are not shaped right so they do not sit comfortably where they should like all my other boy shorts do. Pass these up. |||1
The panties were very cheap looking	 the cut was wrong	 at least in my opinion. The back of the panties didn't reach very far and the legs were somewhat tight. |||1
It didn't fit as I was used to from them. I am very disappointed. |||1
