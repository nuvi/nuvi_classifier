"softness and comfort and a GREAT fit. Briefs may be too ""old-fashioned"" for some younger girls"	 but us REAL WOMEN know what counts! |||1
very comfy and very big I got a size 6	 and wow that is the biggest 6 I've even seen but what ya gonna do? LOL. |||1
I ordered the size to match the measurements on the chart	" but they arrived much too big. The ""height"" on these is pretty crazy.- If you are looking for Granny |||1
panties that go up to your bra	 these may be for you.- If you are looking for normal briefs that don't encompass you're entire mid-section you should look elsewhere. |||1
These panties are cut like other Fruit of the Loom briefs. The sizing is the same asFruit of the Loom Women's 6-Pack Heather Briefswhich I've ordered several times. But	 unlike |||1
the Heather briefs	" these ""Body Tone"" briefs have no lining in the crotch area. I've purchased Fruit of the Looms for years"	 and these are the first briefs that lacked |||1
a lining.The product description cays that colors will vary. My package contained 2 pink	 2 beige	 1 cranberry	 and 1 black brief. Because they're not lined	 I wouldn't buy these |||1
again. |||1
I ordered these for my monthly accidents if needed. I wish the whole package was black but they do the job. |||1
I am not a fan of going to the store so the convenience of ordering these online far outweighed my need to do more laundry. |||1
Fits well in the waist but the fit is a little loose everywhere else. The material is cool and comfortable	 and overall good for the price. |||1
Don't last very long. I was disappointed in that |||1
Was pleased with fast delivery and quality of these briefs.They fit perfect true to size accordingly as ad mentioned.Was well did not fade	 kept it's shape which was veryImportant to |||1
Me. Packaged Nicely in One package too. |||1
I am a big fan of fruit of the loom products	 and this one did not disappoint. The fit was great. |||1
I wear a size 16 slacks and the size 7 Fruit of the Loom are a great fit	 comfortable and non-clingy. I liked the choice of colors in the package; |||1
I often find bawdy prints	 bright colors	 or all white	 which I don't like. I would love packs of all black	 but this variety will work just fine.Fruit of the |||1
Loom continues to give affordable and well made products. The cotton is soft and feels nice against your body	 even in hot and humid Florida temps!! I think it's time |||1
to get rid of all my old panties and stock up with Fruit of the Loom ones... |||1
I have quite a few of these panties and every one of them have been ripped at the waits band. They are comfy but I don't like how shabby they |||1
are at the waist. They need a better waistband. The Hanes NO RIDE UP are better. |||1
I bought this for a relative and she loved the fit and the comfort of the underwear. They seem durable and come in a good variety of colors to match |||1
any outfit. |||1
These briefs are quite comfortable and of good quality and the price is excellent so I would highly recommend them to any woman for daily wear. |||1
These fit me okay	 although somehow not quite as well as their competitor's. My main complaint is that you don't get the colors shown in the pic	 and they certainly |||1
"shouldn't be called ""Body Tone"". I ordered two packages that both included 2 light pink"	 1 nude	 and 1 black	 (which were fine) but the other two pairs were a |||1
dark rose that wasn't depicted and I have no use for. Do you know anyone who has naturally dark rose skin? I really wish someone would offer a multi pack |||1
with either all nude or a nude/black assortment. |||1
Ahh	 cotton	 soft	 comfortable and no silly colors. All natural	 neutral comfy bottom covers! Brand new great price!Shipped fast	 would buy again. |||1
I've purchased Fruit of the Loom brief panties before and been very happy with the quality. These	 again	 are good quality but even though I order my usual size	 were |||1
on the small side. |||1
These fit on the small side	 and the material is so thin you can read the newspaper through them. Wish they were made in America! |||1
I think I ordered the wrong size. Just a little big even after washing	 but good material. The price is right and the shipping was fast! Thanks! |||1
The Underwear fit very comfortable	 and are soft on my body skin.I would recommend them for women to wear	everyday. |||1
I love to be comfortable in whatever I wear. These panties are just that.I will be buying more of these soon.A woman should always have more than enough underweare. |||1
I gave this 4 stars because while it was NOT what I intended to buy	 if you're looking for ...um... generously-sized ... full-coverage panties	 THESE ARE THEM! I bought the |||1
same size I buy in a brick&mortar; store	 and these are ~generous~	 as I said.If you're looking for chonies that go up to your ribcage	 you've found them. The only |||1
reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the waistband seems a little scratchy (to the hand--I didn't put them on).The colors are very nice.But they're Gigantopanties. |||1
Full coverage undies. They fit like they are supposed to and cover what they are supposed to. Not sexy by any means but they good underwear. |||1
These are a bit thicker than the bikinis I bought. I like how they fit. They are hi cut briefs and they fit just like the name suggests... cover all |||1
my bottom and sits at or right above my navel. Perfect to lounge around the house in or sleep in. However. if I am going out and wearing a fitted |||1
dress/ skirt/ pants then these panties would not be worn; I can't afford for everyone to see my 'granny panty lines'. But hey	 that's why we have different underwear for |||1
different occasions	 right? I purchased the size 8 and I wear a size 18. The only prob I had with these are the colors. I received 2 of the same |||1
color -2 pink	 2 striped	 2 white (would have preferred a variety of colors). By the way	 can't they go easy on these white panties? Give me darker colors please!!!! |||1
These are an excellent fit and I like how you can buy a package with more than 3 in it. |||1
There just underwear. Fit fine and the price is fine. I would buy again. I feel I got what I paid for. |||1
I wanted to try Fruit of the Loom to see if they were similar to Jockey French Cuts which I love but they are a little expensive because I need |||1
100% cotton on my skin. These were super thin and did not seem like cotton but more polyester. Not the same size fit as Jockey or quality. I'm going back |||1
Jockey's. |||1
Mostly stuck to Hanes brand before	 but no more. I love these Fruit of the Loom undies. Will definitely be buying more. |||1
This panties don't extend or stretch. the fabric is soft	 are easy to wash. Soft and beautiful color. I recomend it |||1
Eh	 they're underwear	 what can I say. They fit as expected and haven't gotten saggy or torn or anything like that. But! I ordered an assorted package and what I |||1
got was a pack of all white panties. Kind of boring	 and not really what I wanted. but regardless of color they do what they need to do. |||1
Son muy buenas	 la calidad y las tallas son acorde con lo que uno pide	 el envio es rapido	 solo me parece que estan un poco costosas. |||1
These panties fit perfectly	 so the size is accurate. They don't ride up	 which is majorly important. The top doesn't roll down...the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars rather |||1
"than 5 is the fact that cotton they're made from is a little rough and scratchy...almost a ""wool"" feeling. They do not itch or irritate or anything of the sort...they |||1
just aren't as soft as I had hoped they'd be. They may soften up with washing & time...but I don't know that yet. Overall	 I like them well enough. I |||1
would buy them again...but if I had my choice they'd be softer...but then	 if they were softer	 they'd likely cost more. |||1
Bought this for a gift	 not for me. But my mom really liked them and the texture is really lightweight and comfortable. |||1
These were way too big	 but it was my own fault for ordering the wrong size! I figured I give them some leeway to shrink	 but they didn't shrink much |||1
at all in the wash...the style in the photo looks better	 though	 they don't seem like they are hi-cut in the legs. I DID find the right style and size |||1
from FOTL just recently...if you order these	 I would just order true to size! Delivery was quick as well! |||1
They have worn and washed well so far. The size was accurate and I haven't noticed much shrinkage. I'll have to wear them awhile before I can form any more |||1
of an opinion but for now	 I'm pleased with them. |||1
These are okay	 a bit tight at the waist and leg. I purchased the right size	 but they run a bit tight. |||1
I love the fit of these. They offer the right amount of coverage without being constricting. They also don't ride up. Great fit at a great price. I can't say |||1
anything more. |||1
These panties were not only too little	 but the material was too thin. A couple of washes and they would be done. I had go give them away to much	 |||1
much	 smaller sister... |||1
Love the colors and prints. Lots of fun. The panties fits beautifully and wash very well. I let them hang dry	 but being cotton they do fine in the dryer |||1
with other lightweight cotton items. Fruit of the Loom has a comfortable waist band that has a soft	" almost ""peached"" inside that's soft against your skin. I'm 5'3"" and 135 |||1
lbs and needed a size 6 for a comfortable fit. They seem very well made and should last a long time. |||1
I've been looking for hi-cut briefs for some time now. I can't seem to find the REALLY high cut ones that I used to get	 but these do come close. |||1
They are true to size and OH so comfortable. I even forget that they're not cut as high as I usually like lol. I'll be purchasing more to replace these |||1
when they wear out! A+Update July 2013: I've had these for over a year	" and I can now say that they are very durable. I purchased these with ""another brand"" |||1
at the same time	 and those have unraveled. Not so with these	 so I will be ordering more to replace the ones that fell apart. I don't know why these |||1
are getting a bad rap. They are really very nice. |||1
Very good buy - soft and nice colors. Perfect fit and very comfortable. So glad I bought these. Great value. |||1
I usually wear a 7 in Hanes	 and from the reviews here	 I went with the size to 8. Mine are a little roomy in the derriere portion. I'm not |||1
sure how the 7 would have fit	 but I'm thinking maybe I should have stuck with the size 7.I noticed on the package they had two size recommendations: 12-14 should |||1
go for a 7	 and 14-16 should move to an 8. So that's kinda putting us size 14 women in two different groups. My recommendation: If you're on the smaller |||1
size of a 14	 go with the 7. |||1
These are comfortable but you may need to wash & run them through the dryer to make them a perfect fit. I don't mind the prints	 solids and whites. |||1
The panties fit fine but I did not receive the colors that are displayed. I got black	 2 white	 navy polka dot on white	 teal green	 and a whimsical floral |||1
pattern. This set would not have been my first choice but it isn't worth sending them back. |||1
The size is not very suitable me. But the quality is great. And I received it very soon after I place the order of it. |||1
they're a bit like granny panties	 almost to my waist....bikini are too low for me though	i guess i have to keep looking..nice material though and i like that |||1
This is a nice six-pack of cotton briefs .They fit well	 don't ride up or bind. The package contains 3 pairs of solid colors and 3 pairs of patterned briefs. |||1
They are very comfortable. |||1
A good product. Comfortable to wear and waist does not extend above jeans.Holds up well to washing. Wasn't able to choose my own colours but the ones that came were |||1
nce enough that I didn't mind. Would buy again. |||1
its cheap for sure !!but the fabric is so so Lightits very comfortablebut gets old quicklyso not that goodthank you |||1
My friend asked me to grab her some underwear while I was online. I just asked her	 she said they were good. It's odd to have underwear conversations. |||1
I wear a size 6 in underwear and these were just that...a size 6. They fit me perfectly and I'd order another set next time of the same kind. I |||1
really like them alot! |||1
My wife says she will tell her friends that they are a good buy.Looking at them on her looked real good.artras@att.net |||1
Nothing special here. A few pairs have not held up in the wash as much as I'd like but other than that	 they serve their purpose. |||1
took size based on makers sizing chart for hips so took a large however its bout 3/4 inch too big 	 they fit but not perfectly 	 material is comfy |||1
and colours nice 	will order size lower next time	 would recommend to friends. |||1
I have purchased this same brand	 style	 and size in stores for years. Sometimes I can't find my size	 so I decided to buy online. I thought I would get |||1
what was represented in the picture: pastel colors and subtle prints. Instead I received garish colors and circus-clown prints. Additionally	 the fabric was very thin	 and the fit was more |||1
like bikini than hipster style. (It did say hipster on the package I received.)No more online underwear shopping for me! |||1
Okay	 the price was right. But I bought a similar cheap 6-pack at Costco that was much better quality. I'll look for a different brand next time. |||1
After two or three washings and air drying	 the elastic no longer was snug on my leg. i can't recommend these panties. |||1
Very cute hipster cut with colorful designs	 very comfortable to wear. They fit fairly well	 just a teensy bit smaller than I expected. Great for women like me with absolutely |||1
NO hips! |||1
These are fine and what I expect from Fruit of the Loom. No selection of color or patterns	 though	 so you get what they give you. I got some funky |||1
patterned undies for a middle aged woman! |||1
Made algon	 but very youthful colors are great	 nothing to do with the measures announced in the sizes are very large. |||1
Love the material and the style. The size 5 is a bit too large for me although I am size small. |||1
I bought these underwear to accommodate my expanding body since I'm currently pregnant. I choose a size large based on my pre-pregnancy measurement	 which were waist: 29 inches and hips: |||1
"41 inches. These measurement fell into the ""large"" bracket. Even after gaining 20 pounds they are still too big. |||1
These fit like I expect hipsters to fit. They seem comfortable enough; however	 if you are soft around the hips then the waist and leg elastics will create a roll |||1
between them. It's not uncomfortable	 but it's not pretty either. |||1
very nice cotton	 fun patterns	 perfect unobtrusive fit	 follows the body during pilates	 yoga	 rowing i'll buy another batch - |||1
I love cotton underwear especially ones that aren't granny panties. So glad I got them. Thank you! They are great! |||1
Fruit of the Loom Women's 6-Pack Cotton Hipster	Assorted	5100% Algodon.Comodidad para uso diario...bajo costo	 tiempo de entrega OK; embalaje de envio conforme.Compra recomendada	 tamano conforme estandares establecidos. |||1
I agree with another reviews the panties received are not as shown. The ones received have cheap quality elastic sewn on the waistband and on the outside of the legs	 |||1
the ones shown have an encased elastic on the leg. The colors were nice and bright but the material was a lower quality. My biggest complaint is that they did |||1
not even cover entire backside	 which is not large by any means. I would not recommend purchasing this style. |||1
I usually like Fruit of the Loom cotton panties but the quality cotton is very poor and the fit is loose because of the poor quality and weight of the |||1
cotton and the elastic band. |||1
Wonky ....... well it almost seems as if the leg holes are larger than they should be but I think the crotch of the panty is actually too narrow. FL |||1
usually fits but these are well.....wonky |||1
The material is pure cotton but not fine cotton	 so it is a bit scratchy. The size is somewhat small. |||1
These fit well. They come in good patterns and colors. Do be warned that you don't have control over the colors you receive	 |||1
What can I say other than these are great underwear for practical women. They are not too low where they slide down the legs of your pants or too high |||1
to make you feel like an ol' lady	 lol. Love em. |||1
They fit well and are very comfortable. For the price they can't be beat. However if you are looking for something sexy	 this isn't for you |||1
Pretty comfortable! I bought it because it's made of cotton. The only thing I don't like is that some of the colors in the batch I got are	 er	 not |||1
flattering - I got a yellow one which just looks so juvenile! So if you are interested	 remember that they come in ASSORTED COLORS. Good luck on what you get! |||1
These are really comfy underwear and they breathe very well. I bought these just after we had my daughter and they didnt cut me or move that much. Would buy |||1
these again! |||1
These panties fit very snug and stay in place. A very great deal for six pairs. The sizing is perfect. Its hard to gauge sometimes with so many companies declaring |||1
size's that are different. These are what they are. |||1
Way to little I didn't think they would b that tiny. Im 5 feet 120 pounds but to little for me. |||1
These were comfortable and cool for the summer. They are basic and good for a quick packing into a weekend bag. |||1
Very comfortable. Don't ride up. Good quality. I am happy with the product for the price. Cute designs also. Thanks. |||1
they don't fit like i thought they would and the band was a little uncomfortable but they are my 2nd fav. |||1
"As they confirmed as my wife ""are comfortable"	 soft	 good material	 the right size	 they are recommending to their friends and family. |||1
The size was right	 the colors are very pretty. good quality. liked the girl very much .. very good price for the package |||1
These comfortable boyshort panties fit great. I love the cotton material	 which breathes easily. They feel and look smooth under fitted pants. You can't go wrong with Fruit of the |||1
Loom! I recommend this product to anyone who wants to feel like they're wearing nothing next to their skin. |||1
I took a chance on these underwear even though the reviews were lukewarm. I have to continue with the theme that these underwear are mediocre. They were a little bigger |||1
than I expected based on the size I ordered and the material is very thin. I think the colors I got were a pink	 maroon	 and the other pair were |||1
turquoise. The elastic is very thin at the waist and overall they are just OK. A very boring pair of underwear. They look much cuter in the picture than in |||1
real life. Just a boring pair of everyday underwear that are a bit loose in fit. I wanted them to be big so that I could wear them to bed |||1
- they are too big and they fall down. My mistake to order up so big. I based the larger size on other pairs of similar underwear that I have |||1
bought in the past but they have spandex in them and these don't as far as I can tell. You don't any patterned pairs like you see in the picture |||1
which I think may give them a bit of pizazz. |||1
the fit of these are off. they are not shaped right so they do not sit comfortably where they should like all my other boy shorts do. Pass these up. |||1
The panties were very cheap looking	 the cut was wrong	 at least in my opinion. The back of the panties didn't reach very far and the legs were somewhat tight. |||1
It didn't fit as I was used to from them. I am very disappointed. |||1

This is a great tutu and at a really great price. It doesn't look cheap at all. I'm so glad I looked on Amazon and found such an affordable tutu |||1
that isn't made poorly. A++ |||1
I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for dance class, she wore it today for the first time and the teacher thought it was adorable. I bought this |||1
to go with a light blue long sleeve leotard and was happy the colors matched up great. Price was very good too since some of these go for over $15.00 |||1
dollars. |||1
What can I say... my daughters have it in orange, black, white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one. It is a very good |||1
way for exalt a dancer outfit: great colors, comfortable, looks great, easy to wear, durables and little girls love it. I think it is a great buy for costumer and |||1
play too. |||1
We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus |||1
have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, |||1
the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult. |||1
Thank you Halo Heaven great product for Little Girls. My Great Grand Daughters Love these Tutu's. Will buy more from this seller. Made well and cute on the girls. Thanks |||1
for a great product.NEVER BUY FROM DRESS UP DREAMS........I will buy more as long as I don't buy from "Dress Up Dreams" I never rec'd or order in FL. Only |||1
rec'd pink, the purple one was missing. Company is a rip off. REFUSES to make good on purchase...... Real creeps. |||1
I received this today and I'm not a fan of it but my daughter is I thought it would be puffier as it looks in the pic but it's not |||1
and the one they sent me is pink underneath and the waist band is pink which is not what I wanted due to the fact she already had the sandals |||1
she was gonna wear with it now I gotta find another pair of sandals,ima just keep it cuz she likes it. |||1
Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear. So far, she's using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure |||1
we'll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon. The quality is just fine for the price we paid. I was not expecting a designer skirt for this |||1
price and got exactly what I paid for. |||1
Great tutu for a great price. It isn't a "full" or high quality skirt, but it is perfect for my daughter to wear over leggings for her little outfits. |||1
My daughter liked this, and it with her costume, but she would have liked it to be a bit fuller. |||1
For what I paid for two tutus is unbeatable anywhere! I ordered a pink and turquios and they are vibrant and beautiful! The tutu is very full! Princess style! Not |||1
cheaply made! Not cheap materia! Obviously someone made these with love and care! I paid less than 7 bucks for a tutu I and I feel proud of my self |||1
for researching to the point of finding gold!Recommend 2-6 years!My daughter is two ! Wears size 4t and this skirt ( one size ) fit perfect and will probaly be |||1
able to accommodate her quickly growing waist for some time! |||1
Wonder my niece wears it every single day, yellow is her favorite color right now an this cute little tutu made he da. It is well built and we hope |||1
she gets lots of wear out of it. |||1
My daughter has worn this skirt almost every day since she received it and it's even been through the washer along with the other clothes. It's amazing quality! She fits |||1
a 4T and it's just above her knee, and has a little bit of growing room, although I'm not so sure as much as others are saying. But considering how |||1
often she wears it, I'm not worried! ;) |||1
Purchased this tutu for my granddaughter's first birthday. It fit nicely with room to grow in. I'm very please with it and will purchase more in varying colors in the |||1
future. |||1
Full and well stitched. This tutu is a beautiful purple color that looks just like the picture. It looks just adorable on our little fairy. |||1
This was a gift for a two year old and a five year old. The girls squealed upon opening the box, they grabbed the tutus, put them on, and wore |||1
them the rest of the day. The tutus seem to be well made, and can stand up to handling by little princesses. I recommend these tutus. |||1
My 3yr old loved this tutu skirt in pink! Was hoping to order more in different colors.She had hardly used this,the stitching came apart in 2weeks.now it's lying in her |||1
closet..Altogether she wore it like 4-5 times for 20 mins or so.wish the stitching was of better quality to hold up while little ones wear it. Can't recommend. |||1
Perfect for my budding grand daughter ballerina! Beautiful vibrant color. Fits great and easy to clean! I bought several more colors! |||1
Never GOT this item - but gave a 1 STAR because the replies from the SUPPLIER was GREAT.They tried to send the item more than once.My $ was refunded in |||1
a timely manner too.It was a shame I never got it for my daughter - it would of looked great with her OUTFIT for Dr. Seuss WEEK at school.Most original.Maybe |||1
next time. |||1
Nice and puffy tutu skirt. I would recommend this for girls under 10 yr. old. It will be too short and small for older girls. |||1
Bought this for my niece as part of her fairy outfit. She loves it and wears it all the time. Well made for the price. |||1
My 4 year old daughter always wants to play dress up. I bought this for her for Christmas and she never wanted to take it off. It is almost a |||1
year later and she still has it!! It was well worth the money and has held up this long with nothing wrong with it!! I would recommend it |||1
Our granddaughters are all very girlie, so when the youngest one received this for Christmas, they all wanted it! Great color and fit for a 2 year old as well |||1
as her aunt who is 30! I would recommend this tutu for all little girls. |||1
Prompt delivery, and it is exactly as described. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet- so I don't know how |||1
it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :) She's on the |||1
little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect! The elastic waist will expand with her as she grows. |||1
The minute I saw this my heart skipped a beat. What a nice case to sort my collection. I love all the compartments and the layout too. You will love |||1
this color too. If this is a gift do not hesitate. It will please even the most fussy, as I am. The price is fair if you check around as |||1
I did. Seems well made too. It is suitable for an adult though. Not meant as a toy. This is for serious jewelry lover's. Buy it..... |||1
Love this Jewelry Box so well put together holds plendy... Love the pink & looks so nice on my vanity. |||1
This products is great for anyone with a lot of jewelry my girlfriend has a lot and this gift for her was one of my best ideas! i recommend this |||1
to any one with a lot of jewelry |||1
I already own this particular Shining Image jewelry box in brown, so this was my second buy. It arrived with some of the leather scratched, even though it looked like |||1
I was the first one opening the box. This particular color pink also looked pretty bad in person. The quality of this box seemed lesser than the brown one I |||1
own.I returned this pink case for a refund without a problem. Got another brown Shining Image jewelry case and it's fine! |||1
I wanted to have the title summarize my thoughts if you decide not to read the entire review. My granddaughter likes the Shining Image Jewelry Box given to her for |||1
a birthday gift from Grandma. I wish the drawers were deeper for holding her many necklaces. Also, I wish the drawers had a stop, preventing the drawers from tipping contents |||1
entirely when trying to remove one piece of jewelry. My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling |||1
the drawer from the base requires practice. I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without |||1
spilling the contents. |||1
Really nice box, a bit cheaply made. It is made of carboard with pleather. Although the organization for all your jewelry is great, I'm not so sure how it will |||1
stand up to my tween daughter's use. Every inch is useable space for jewelry & very compact, which is a nice feature. |||1
Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone |||1
software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into |||1
it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, |||1
there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or |||1
maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than |||1
just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while |||1
you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help |||1
retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead |||1
of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they |||1
don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and |||1
living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people. |||1
The product itself is five stars, however the description is faulty. I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first. I really |||1
do like the learning process, it feels intuitive. The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop. So when I learned that |||1
there is an "App for that", I was thrilled. I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I |||1
could learn and practice wherever I needed to. For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour. On day |||1
91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying "no course found for this account". The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion |||1
of the product was just a free trial. If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription. No where on this product page |||1
does it say that the companion apps are a trial version. I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon. I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to |||1
did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former. Amazon did try to assist me by offering a |||1
partial refund but that was not really what I wanted. I want to continue to learn on my iPad! My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to |||1
them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day |||1
trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, "Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad |||1
and iPhone. Three month access included with purchase." I personally think it is still obscure since the part about the mobile companion is much farther down in the description but |||1
at least it is something. |||1
The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum. I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to |||1
use the program in other locations. However, Rosetta Stone's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home. Installation was easy enough even though |||1
the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, |||1
this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty |||1
of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as |||1
an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something |||1
to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules. I feel the need for this and can source it out separately, |||1
but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom.* Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns. |||1
Okay, I admit it. I'm one of the millions of Americans that massively struggles with any language either than English. I have recently returned to college to finish out my |||1
Bachelors. The university I'm enrolled in requires two years of a foreign language. Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now. BUT with using Rosetta, I was not only able to get |||1
through my class without sounding and feeling like an idiot, but I actually got A's!! I never thought that was a possibility. I'm not ready to jet off to France |||1
or anything but I'm not a complete moron any more either. I'm calling that a huge success. Once this whole bachelors things is under my belt, I will be back |||1
to pick up the next level!! |||1
I bought this product a little over a year ago. Now that I am done with it, I wanted to sell it. I put it on eBay and Craigslist. They |||1
had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable, so |||1
you can't sell it as a used item after you're done with it.Total crap ! |||1
I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone software; it's easy and fun to use. The Rosetta Stone "dynamic immersion" method is different than traditional methods where you see a word in |||1
English and then see a word in the new language to memorize. L'etude du franais est reellement amusement et facile! |||1
I've never had french, learned french, or know anything about French. Now, however, I feel like I could do OK with a quick trip and to get around conversationally. Rosetta |||1
Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean |||1
by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty |||1
expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this. |||1
La Femme Boit...... I think that means the girl drinks. Learned that in the first 5 minutes. :)Ok, overall the program is good. This was my first experience with Rosetta |||1
Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a |||1
second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For |||1
starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my |||1
ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow |||1
this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having |||1
to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I |||1
sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install |||1
the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have |||1
to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the |||1
key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second |||1
the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don't want to have to install the application and then a language pack. The software should be smart enough to |||1
install both the app and language pack together to make the process even easier.And yes, I am a software developer so when I review software I look at it from |||1
a complete implementation standpoint. Software is only as good as the installer. |||1
The Rosetta Stone process gets you involve through what they call immersion right away, and I found it quite fun. You run the application and learning CD's through your computer, |||1
plug in your headset/microphone to the USB port, enroll on line for the web support and community and off you go.You can hear it, see it, see how your respond, |||1
and it pretty much sweeps you along and gets you quite involved. I have learned languages(the Romance languages) traditionally in school and self-taught over the years, and I found Rosetta |||1
very helpful and engaging.The negatives are the price, and this is only Level One. It's a fine start, but if you're serious, you're going to have to do a lot |||1
more work and dish out for the next level. Your call!May I suggest, for quick learning, say for a trip: get a tape/cd and a book. Learn the quick, important |||1
phrases, practice some everyday- use it, use it, use it- hear it and say it, and if you can, practice with a native speaker- you really learn that way, and |||1
you get over the nervousness of being ignorant about the language and constantly fretting about making mistakes.If you're willing to pay the price and put in time- some of us |||1
just love computer, and it also includes an Audio CD for practice elsewheres, the Rosetta Stone French will give you a good, fun start into French or any new language. |||1
I have had this product for a while to evaluate because I have so enjoyed the format and the refresher course. I have 7 years of high school and college |||1
French but like so many Americans, I never learned to speak or aurally interpret native speech properly. I found the visual and sound exercises extremely helpful and enjoyable. I have |||1
been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on "French" and actually understand much of what being said. I'm not sure |||1
I'd learn formal French grammar this way but I don't think that is the point of the course.I was disappointed that I could not get the speech recognition microphone function |||1
to work despite many weeks of attempts, use of customer service and other techie help. My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was |||1
never able to get that working. Even so, the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills. Merci!Based upon this experience, |||1
I'd definitely consider buying the next course if I could be assured the voice recognition piece would work. |||1
Bring French to life!If your child is taking their first year of French or you are ready to head off on vacation and want to learn the language yourself, Rosetta |||1
Stone is a great learning tool for you both! Version 4 comes with the learning lessons, headset with mic, app to use with your iPhone or iPod Touch for on |||1
the go learning and access to a virtual community online for lessions, games and chat! I really don't think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is |||1
that I didn't know about this product sooner! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as |||1
well! |||1
I got this product for my sister who enjoyed taking 4 years of French in high school. Here is what she had to say about the product:>>>THIS IS AMAZING! I |||1
loved working with this product! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly, and it was fun to do. They show you pictures and then show you the |||1
French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can |||1
do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have |||1
you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills. I would highly recommend this |||1
product to my fellow peers! I am excited to try French Level 2 and learn even more!<<<I asked her if she had tried any other language learning products that she |||1
could compare it to and she said she had not, but she was very happy with this. |||1
.When in the military, I was stationed in Europe for several years. The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: "What do you call a person who |||1
speaks three languages? Trilingual; What do you call a person who speaks two languages? Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language? American.I have wanted to improve |||1
my language status for many years. My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy. I considered the other romance languages |||1
(Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, |||1
Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought. Of course the grammar |||1
I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier. Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is |||1
limited in grammar. After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak |||1
French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human. Soon I remembered my years living in Germany. I had studied German, but could not |||1
really have a meaningful conversation with a German. When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American). Those who did not |||1
speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words. The lesson for me |||1
is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language. Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not |||1
get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends. I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan. I am unlikely to |||1
encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it. Then I will tell them I am "quadri lingual.". Do you think that will |||1
work? . . . Neither do I. |||1
If you really need to learn a new language, and learn it fast, Rosetta Stone is the way. I've taken college/high school and even junior high classes and learned. I |||1
took a Berlitz course and learned. But by far, the fastest way to a new language - and outside of taking one as a kid in public school - the |||1
cheapest way, too, is Rosetta Stone.No, I don't work for them or even get to date that spokeswoman in the tight blue dress. But I do love learning languages and |||1
I really like RS. Lots of options to learn so you won't get bored. Very little of the repeat-after-me stuff from normal classes. And actual fun lessons. Plus iphone apps |||1
and internet based learning. They have the bases covered.Ok, what I don't like - the complexity of the install with all the verifications and such. I understand the need to |||1
prevent software theft. It seems like, as usual, the legitimate purchasers end up paying the price ($ and install-wise) for the people that don't. Arg! I'm not sure how easy/hard |||1
it would be to install it on two machines or even how hard a reinstall would be should you need to move to a new computer, but I dread finding |||1
out!That little caveat aside - and it only pertains to installing the one time - this is a TERRIFIC product. It ain't cheap, but real learning seldom is. And the |||1
benefits to you are huge. |||1
Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I |||1
went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was |||1
a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English. you will only see pictures and hear Italian. This means you'll learn |||1
more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own. Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a "male", the picture will be different each |||1
time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the |||1
picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and |||1
pick the commonality. Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL |||1
DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on. It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was |||1
happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember |||1
it, and basically memorized it through this recall. I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on. I did not |||1
feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS. This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- |||1
PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high. Yes I know these things cost money, |||1
and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent |||1
so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set. I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price |||1
in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more. (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately. I am not going to |||1
buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out. $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES |||1
ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails. I mean, I |||1
KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said "PO" (for |||1
example) instead of something unrecognizable. It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck. Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the |||1
same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that |||1
I could learn some additional words on my own. (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that |||1
this program is no substitute for classroom participation. (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any |||1
more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences. One thing I noticed is that the "putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them" part of |||1
Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections. She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice. Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't |||1
an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is |||1
a good deal. (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other |||1
books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations. |||1
Although I haven't kept up with the lessons as I should have, I have learned a lot of Italian with only the first level. I spoke some dialect, but have |||1
conjugation issues! This is most assuredly the best program I've used to learn Italian. I have the older version too, and I like the new audio-visual matching; it's different from |||1
the older version and moves a lot faster.With this version, you can move at your own pace a lot easier, and see your mistakes sooner, which is helpful.Not only does |||1
this have visual learning, and learning by audio, but also by speaking, and comparing your pronunciation to that of a native speaker, which I think is the most helpful part |||1
of the software. The way the teaching of the language is set up, is I believe, the closest to learning it naturally with native speakers. I highly recommend this software...grazie! |||1
I've always found learning a new language to be a huge challenge. Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the |||1
fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. |||1
No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the |||1
language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language |||1
(and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality |||1
was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would |||1
be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new |||1
language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to "try on" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced |||1
versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language. If you're willing to put in the time, it does produce results. |||1
I was thrilled to get the Rosetta Stone and be able to begin a lifelong desire to speak Italian!The software was very easy to load and use. The simple approach |||1
to learning a language as a child does was one terrific idea!I agree with other posters that to become fluent you will need to purchase more than just this level |||1
1 program. However, this does allow you to learn some simple things and I do feel you could communicate enough to get your idea across.And, it is FUN to do! |||1
I'm enjoying it immensely! |||1
I love Rosetta Stone it is easy to use in a few quick lessons you are speaking Italian. I like how the lessons are short and easy to finish.i like |||1
the pictures I can't wait to go to Italy. |||1
Install Machine:Intel iMac 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, OS 10.6.6Install was smooth and easy. No hangups. It immediately asked if I wanted to update after |||1
I installed. It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly. Need admin privileges to install software. Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes |||1
or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy. The only issue I had was |||1
getting the included microphone/headset to work right. It kept telling me to say "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone. |||1
I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine. In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be |||1
done. I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for |||1
just the microphone? Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too. He quickly |||1
picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes |||1
until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English. It was only images and Italian words and speaking. |||1
This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe |||1
being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words. However, it is |||1
still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is |||1
high. However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class? The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost. So given the high |||1
price, I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner. Great for those who don't have time to take an instructor lead course. |||1
Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1 is easy to install and use. The included instructions are simple and straightforward. Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the |||1
code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, |||1
but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up |||1
initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get |||1
a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing |||1
in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you |||1
to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and |||1
forth. This isn't a big deal for most people, and there's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone, like the US Army and State Department. |||1
There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible, but I felt it should focus on more |||1
useful phrases. 45 minutes of repeating various forms of "Boys eating", or "girls running" are not phrases that have much tactical value when you're visiting or operating in a different |||1
country.Overall: 4/5 stars |||1
I was prepared to be disappointed with Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1, the first Rosetta Stone I've tried. It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied |||1
two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with |||1
the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a |||1
couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding |||1
the Rosetta program. The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had |||1
to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set |||1
really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, |||1
it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged |||1
and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written. Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases. Total immersion, everything is shown on |||1
the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer. Everything is accompanied |||1
by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways: you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy |||1
running, boys running). In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which |||1
is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and |||1
other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used |||1
mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for "talking to myself". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD. The CD |||1
is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard |||1
on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the |||1
computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. |||1
From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. |||1
You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm |||1
for me in Pacific Standard Time zone. Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late. If you're in the |||1
Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee |||1
will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for |||1
Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with |||1
no problems. |||1
I actually have used the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1 & 2 and found it great in terms of learning the language. At first, the Rosetta Stone method seems harder |||1
because you associate pictures with words and phrases but their whole premise is that is how you first learned a language by seeing something and then associating the word with |||1
that object or action. It is way better than pure memorization! I have gone through several lessons and I am picking it up rather quickly as I have a background |||1
in Spanish. Overall a great way to learn a new language! |||1
I've been using this for a few weeks. Previously, my Italian was limited to stuff I'd see on "The Godfather" and a few foods. I'm a bit better now, and |||1
eager to see what the further levels of Rosetta Stone look like. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning like living there, but it's pretty useful as a |||1
tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- |||1
Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is |||1
almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this. |||1
I have to admit, I was more impressed by Rosetta Stone than I thought I'd be. I learned French the old fashioned way (four years in high school and more |||1
in college), so the idea of taking on a new language in a way I had never tried before seemed like an interesting alternative.It was a lot more enjoyable than |||1
I thought it would be. I have a smattering of Italian from my family, and this added to it when I began to recognize words I had never seen before, |||1
but only heard.It installed on my Mac with no problems. I had a few issues with the microphone, but if you google it (there is help online), I found a |||1
fix that worked with little effort.I can't say Level 1 of Rosetta Stone is going to make you speak like a native, but after sampling this, it really does make |||1
you want to go onto the next phase, if it's as painless as this was. |||1
I've had the opportunity to review several Rosetta Stone language software programs and have found them all to be quite good. They all seem to follow the same basic structure |||1
which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language. I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language |||1
but am not motivated to try and become fluent. Level One for me, is just right. However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase |||1
Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose |||1
the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian. I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language. Also, I like |||1
being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes. I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you |||1
can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the |||1
program itself. After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to |||1
any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied. I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language. Of course it |||1
would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a |||1
good job as a cultural immersion substitute. |||1
I wanted a refresher course in Italian so I ordered this Rosetta Stone Italiano - Level 1. This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run |||1
across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results. Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues |||1
with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed. For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language |||1
software to work properly and Vista needs SP2. It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems. If you |||1
have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements. Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start |||1
booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services. The quick start guide is important to read first and provides |||1
support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze). The software installed easily on Windows 7 |||1
as did the included headset via usb port. The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual |||1
stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic. I had |||1
an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software. I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the |||1
time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal. I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), |||1
builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation. The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) |||1
and shopping (unit 4). Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states |||1
it includes free online features, they are free for three months only. There is a $25 monthly fee or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the |||1
trial period. The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account. I strongly suggest you use |||1
the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software. The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, |||1
and an online community to practice your Italian. I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons |||1
to get more out of it. It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian |||1
if you can afford the hefty price tag. For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more |||1
convenient and provides more personalized service. Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost. I don't |||1
think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price. |||1
I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus. |||1
I got Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 a few months prior to a vacation in Rome, mainly because the last time my wife and I visited Italy, we went without |||1
knowing any Italian and all... and that made for some frustration.I speak Japanese and some Spanish, so I am familiar with the challenges involved in learning a new language. However, |||1
Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian. This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions |||1
at shops and for directions, mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess, in Italian, |||1
that I only knew a very little Italian. So at least they could understand what I was able to say! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening |||1
but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country, but the pace in which you learn is |||1
really up to you. There are so many options that I didn't use... like the online lessons, the games, the community. I just didn't have the time for those and |||1
found the basic tutorials quite sufficient (and excellent) but it's great to have those options. |||1
ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an |||1
obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any |||1
Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the |||1
ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You |||1
can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters |||1
are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on |||1
your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. |||1
Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA |||1
STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your |||1
computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. |||1
Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice |||1
recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to |||1
speak the first words a baby might speak..."cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, "BY EAR". First, |||1
not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they |||1
can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are |||1
more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word "ZIA" (Aunt), you will never |||1
GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a "Z", they will not pronouce "TS", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT |||1
THE ITALIAN "Z" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see |||1
"ZIA", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--"ZEE-ah", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has |||1
other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct |||1
sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding "D" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the |||1
Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you |||1
the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away |||1
from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, |||1
so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system |||1
DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's |||1
why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say |||1
it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say "The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'." Instead, you |||1
are suppose to just KNOW this. Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you |||1
to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake |||1
in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with |||1
a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have |||1
taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not |||1
pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you |||1
might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that |||1
go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that |||1
covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, |||1
that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. "ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer |||1
lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet |||1
is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other |||1
problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says "DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to |||1
move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up |||1
for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the |||1
lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They |||1
have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN |||1
LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of |||1
the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of |||1
high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as |||1
you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if |||1
you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE |||1
RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the |||1
program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If |||1
some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your |||1
vocabulary, and engage you in an "immersion" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can. NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem |||1
is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if |||1
you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI! |||1
We got this costume for my son to wear to Disneyland. My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume |||1
is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well |||1
over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has |||1
an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little |||1
bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, |||1
and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom). He absolutely LOVES the |||1
costume, and has worn it everywhere (except school) since he got it. |||1
Purchased this costume (size 3T-4T) and it's a perfect fit for my very tall 2 year old son. I couldn't have asked for a better fit if we'd tried it |||1
on in a store first. I also bought the inflatable jet pack/wings. Can't wait to see him all dressed up on the big day! |||1
I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011. It arrived one week earlier than expected, and I was happy about this. My grandson absolutely loved it! |||1
I'm glad I ordered the larger size (Size 8) because it barely fit him. The material was durable and well made, I think. He's worn it many times just to |||1
play in since Halloween. I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent. |||1
Everything perfect. Thanks, nice quality, excellent price, great deal!!! I recommend it 100%, the color and size are as I expected. |||1
Good costume. Very detailed. I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own. You might not be able to tell from the |||1
picture, but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs, and gauntlets on the sleeves. Nice touch. It is a little thin overall. You'll definitely want to put something underneath |||1
if you're in a colder climate. My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black. It's ok for us because I bought the inflatable wings, but |||1
without the wings, I think it would look weird. |||1
My 2.5 year old got the 3-4 year suit. It's a little tight to begin with, so he fit in it just fine. The pants were a little longer, but |||1
with shoes, he fit it, no problem. (He is "average" height and weight, for a 2.5 year old, according to docs.) If your child is "meaty" at all like mine |||1
is on top, I would suggest getting the larger size.After reading the other reviews about how flimsy this costume was, I didn't let my kiddo wear it until the actual |||1
day of Halloween. He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy |||1
a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks |||1
a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!! For the price |||1
we paid ($35), I am very happy with the purchase and the pictures of him enjoying being the Heroic "Buzz" will last forever, even if the suit doesn't! |||1
This is one of the cutest costumes I've ever seen! My son loved being Buzz for Halloween and we got so many compliments while out in the neighborhood. The material |||1
is a little thin so we layered with a pair of white long johns and it worked great. |||1
My grandson wore this costume for Halloween. It was just as pictured and he had a blast wearing this along with tthe inflatable wings and helmet that we purchsed separately. |||1
My grandson has been a costume lover for the past three years and I have ordered many from Amazon, His picture that his mother sent was adorable. SO thumbs up |||1
My grandson is 5 and I gave him this for Christmas. It has hat, suit and "boots" and he put it all on right away and wore it home. This |||1
is not a high-quality outfit but for the price it should get him nicely through this phase. |||1
This costume is adorable. My child loves it. He puts it on all the time and it's not even Halloween yet. |||1
My son wouldn't wear it because he can be a stick in the mud. However, the costume is very cute, came within e boot covers, holster, bandana, hat, and one |||1
piece costume. I only wish it ran a little bigger so he could wear it in a few weeks or months if he ever lightens up and enjoys dressing up |||1
in costumes. |||1
Have they lost their minds??!! Over 100$ for a costume!! Amazon, you are an idiot. This is an inexpensive costume. It better include a meeting with Tom Hanks for that |||1
price. |||1
my boy is almost 4yrs old and size chils s fits perfectly even with room to grow.boot covers are awesome! he loved them!.would definetly recommend this... for 10 bucks it |||1
is really great! |||1
better quality than I expected for the price - was able to adjust it so it hung at the side rather than straight in front easily - this was our |||1
'go-to' passport storage solution in Italy where there were a LOT of pickpockets. |||1
I bought this, but it is too large for me. If I put anything in it, it is very visible under my shirts. I ended up buying a runner's belt |||1
with a pocket and that works much easier to strap around my upper waist. I also didn't like the idea of the string around my neck being visible. Thought of |||1
it getting caught or someone seeing it and pulling it. |||1
Exactly what i wanted as a gift for a friends 1st trip to europe.This is made from the soft kind of fabric that is comfortable to sleep with against your |||1
skin.Just the right amount of space to fit a passport and 2 additional sections of the same main pocket,for currency, credit cards, tickets, etc.It's important to get one like this |||1
that has no metal, so it can be worn through security check points,with metal detectors without the need to remove it.This is crucial as no one but you should know |||1
this is where the bulk of your important items are.The one main pocket is closed with a velcro strip.It also has a nice thickness to the cord and well chosen |||1
adjustment buckle for it. |||1
I bought one of these neck stashes for my most recent cruise and used it everyday while on vacation. You can adjust the strap to fit your taste. There are |||1
three sections and you can get quite a bit in it. I stuffed cash, my passport, driver's license and several credit cards in it and still had some room to |||1
spare. |||1
leaving on my trip soon--have tried the pouch on around the waist--it lays flat--and seems comfortable--check with me in a couple of weeks to see how it did on the |||1
trip. |||1
It gives you room to keep your passport (even in a leather passport coverAmerican Tourister Leather Passport Cover), credit cards, important papers, and even has room for some money, and |||1
keeps it in a secure place around your neck. You can keep it tucked between your shirt and t-shirt for security and still get easy access to whatever you need |||1
in it. It is of lightweight nylon construction that doesn't make you hot where you carry it.Don't travel without it!Pluses:Prime eligibleSmall, lightweight, but holds a good bit of 'stuff'Minuses:None at |||1
this time |||1
Love this product. Its small and fits over your neck and under your shirt. I used it on my receint trip to Ireland. Its a lot better then a money |||1
belt. Its a lot easier to get to your money or papers and it is harder for anyone else to get to. I will take it on all my trips |||1
from now on. |||1
I bought this to replace another one I had that was kinda heavy (in comparison). I like this one MUCH better. The strap is long so you can wear it |||1
in a purse style or tighten it up and wear it under your shirt. Fits everything really well, and it's really light. |||1
Used this on our last vacation saves from fumbling through your pockets or bags for passport or reservations. I loved using it, fits comfortable under your shirt. Had my passport, |||1
credit card and wallet in it while going through the airports. |||1
This was a very handy wallet that I used in India.The color is near neutral so it does not show through a shirt but best to wear a vest or |||1
a jacket for additional safetyNice velcro closure keeps money safe.You can easily carry 1,000 rupee bills with comfortAlso can carry valueable documents or passports if you wishNice long neck strap |||1
that can be shortenedEasier than carrything a thick wallet in trouser pants |||1
Arrived on time in perfect condition. went on a 3 week trip in Africa and it was the perfect item to have. |||1
Once I found the special travel wallets for the front pocket I never used this again. Fear of pickpockets is over blown anyway I think having been to the "worst" |||1
cities of Europe and Asia. Just don't talk to people who take an extra interest in you because you are obviously American. |||1
This pouch is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I liked the very adjustable strap. However, I would like for the pouch to be a couple of inches longer to |||1
accommodate the length of a standard boarding pass. I was surprised that it was too short as it seems to me that travel documents would the the most likely thing |||1
to store here, but it could not be closed unless I bent the passes which then made them difficult to remove. A minor gripe, overall I'm satisfied. |||1
This is a Christmas gift for my sixteen year old son. He likes things basic, and this is exactly that. A basic passport and money holder for travel. The color |||1
is not like the picture at all, but I am keeping it and letting him decide.The very light beige will get dirty quickly.The zippered section is fine. I wish the |||1
passport section had a zipper instead of velcro. For the price, it is adequate. |||1
I bought two of these pouches for a recent vacation to Europe. It was comfortable to wear as long as I didn't put too much in it. It was fine |||1
with credit cards, driver's license and some cash but when I added my passport it became a bit heavy and bulky, but not prohibitively so. I think if you are |||1
planning on carrying your passport with credit cards it will work well for you, but if you are not planning on carrying your passport around, a pouch that is smaller |||1
might work better.This pouch is likely a good size if you are carrying quite a bit of stuff, but it will stick out under your clothes if your passport is |||1
in it. A lot more comfortable with only a bit of cash and credit cards.It is also a l longer in length than I realized. Its so long that I |||1
could wear it around my neck and tuck it into my pants. My daughter refused to wear it since it is quite bulky under your clothes. |||1
This is the type of pouch recommended by TV travel hosts. Bought one for my son for trip to France; VERY HANDY and VERY HIDDEN.RECOMMEND. |||1
I recently used this neck stash on a two week trip to France. It was wonderful! I loved it at the airport and at train stations, especially. It is so |||1
helpful to have my hands free yet my passport and bording pass (or train ticket) ready to pull right out instead of fumbling in a purse. I also carried money |||1
and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas (like the Eiffel Tower) I wore it under my shirt for extra security. It's lightweight and the adjustable neck |||1
strap, when adjusted properly, makes this pretty unnoticeable under a shirt. I love the different compartments, as this makes it easier to find what you're looking for right away. |||1
This neck stash is very comfortable and it's a nice size. There are two zippered pockets for cards, passports, cash, etc. and a large velcro flap for larger bills or |||1
boarding passes. |||1
There's nothing special here, but this is what I expected. It's very light weight, and I suspect it wouldn't hold up to much abuse, but hard to beat the price. |||1
My only real complaint is that the zipper pockets are only barely big enough for my passport, so it takes more concentration than I'd prefer to use them for passport |||1
storage. |||1
Quality material, easy to wash and dry, lots of zipper areas and holds more paperwork and currency than you could imagine from seeing just pictures of it. Discreet and comfy |||1
to wear around neck for men or women. |||1
I haven't used this yet, but I purchased it for my next trip. I already have a waist wallet, but I can't get to it without going to a restroom |||1
and partially undressing. This seemed much simpler to use. |||1
I really like this. I ordered several different ones but this one is really convenient for the documents I want to carry close and safe where I can get to |||1
them easily, |||1
I wore this one all over medetaranean. I felt safe EVEN in the Istanbul Grand Bazzar, the most crowded, pushy, pickpocket attracting place on Earth. |||1
Purchased two of these for a European Trip. They were invaluable. We placed our money, cards and passport in them and tucked them under shirts and out of sight. Light |||1
weight and they DO NOT rub or irritate the skin which surprised me. they are washable too! |||1
the last time i travelled i got one of the waist ones, and it was so annoying i never used it. i haven't yet really used this one but i |||1
already feel much better about it. i tried it out when i first opened the box when it came and wore it for a bit around my neck. i don't |||1
like the toggle, but i doubled up the strap and tucked the toggle in the top flap of the stash and it works great. i also wrapped it around my |||1
calf just below my knee to see if that would work too. it worked just fine and i might wear it there when i wear my boots. i'm not sure |||1
if it really needs all those different departments, but that's ok. i don't think it's too big or too small. |||1
This travel pouch is just as described. It fits effortlessly under a shirt and holds all your valuables. My husband won't use it because it feels like a purse to |||1
him, but that is just because he is ultra manly. |||1
This has a lot of pockets and yet is very slim. Took this on a trip outside of the US and the item was lightweight, discreet and very handy. Holds |||1
4 passports easily along with receipts. |||1
great no one got my good stuff It was all hanging around my neck. sturdy and durable, i bought one for my husband |||1
It might just be me. Although it seems well made and sized right. It just seems a bit flimsy to me. I debate if I really should not give it |||1
5 stars as it does everything it advertises itself. When I travel out of country, I have this around my neck and under one layer of clothing. I have my |||1
"throw away" wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place. The neck cord is a |||1
little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord |||1
and a flimsy feel. Again though perhaps being flimsy is a good thing being under clothing making it conceal more. |||1
My dad travels a lot and that is an understatement. I got this item for him for when he was going to some shady places and he got a lot |||1
of use out of it. |||1
The item arrived on time in perfect condition. I took a 3 week trip to Africa and it was the perfect item to have! |||1
My 16 year old granddaughter was going on a trip to France for 10 days with a student group and needed some security that her documents and money would be |||1
safe. Worked just fine, also handy at airport |||1
Soft and really light. Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets. I find this a |||1
very good arrangement. Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the |||1
length of cord so you can wear it high or lower. Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security |||1
is need or no pockets. |||1
This is lightweight, nice material, easy to wear under clothing, secure place for passport, money, hotel key, driver's license. The strap is a little long so we just cut it |||1
off shorter. Perfect for detering pickpockets and not noticeable under a shirt (not so under t-shirts, but still safer than in a pocket) |||1
It's too short to be particularly useful. If it had been about 3 inches longer it would have worked. The problem was when you tilt your suitcases on their side |||1
to roll them, this is so short that the wheels of the attached case come off the ground. The quality of construction looked good. |||1
I bought this strap to hold two suitcases together while running through airports on vacation. We just got home and the strap was a life saver. My suitcases did not |||1
have one attached, so this rugged strap did its job well. |||1
Highly recommend this product. I was easily able to "piggy back" or connect 2 luggage pieces by the handles to easily transport 2 pieces of luggage with my carry-on resting |||1
on the top piece of luggage. Have used this now 3x's and highly recommend it.Wish I had it for earlier travels. |||1
husband needed this strap to be able to attach his briefcase to his carry-on luggage to make navigating through the airport to the gate easier. product fits the bill, is |||1
well-made so it should hold up over time. he's already road-tested on a couple of recent trips and is happy with it. |||1
I travel 3 weeks a month and carry 2 50 lb bags everywhere I go. I have been using this strap for a couple months now to pull both bags |||1
together and it works awesome. I wouldn't go back to traveling without it and the convenience for the price is great.I can even get both bags, when piggybacked, on an |||1
escalator and the strap is strong enough to hold the second bag in the air without snapping or anything. |||1
This is a must have item for travelers. Very sturdy, adjustable. Couldn't live without it for carrying multiple bags. |||1
it doesn't make for an easy set of bags to move about the airport. Use it only id you have to. A samrt cart is better |||1
This would have worked fine if the buckles had bee the same as on my luggage, but they weren't, so I had no use for the thing. |||1
I bought this item to attach the handle of a backpack to a 22" carryon. The strap is well constructed, but the minimum length is too long to avoid your |||1
backpack from dragging the ground when pulling the carryon. A laptop bag or purse is fine, but not anything as vertically high as a backpack. I purchased the Travelon bungee |||1
cord for this purpose and will try it on my next trip. I'd shorten the minimum length of this thing and it would be fine. Otherwise, it will be fine |||1
with a checked bag coupled with a smaller carryon or purse/backpack. But for smaller luggage, not so much. |||1
This adjustable straps fit around my messenger bag, which has to pieces of cloth on both sides of the front flap, and have sufficient length to secure it, as a |||1
back up to the velcro closures. They have a heavy plastic clip that "clicks" to make sure they close. Very useful. |||1
Good for connecting one bag to another, but likely to get lost at some point. I am using to connect my laptop bag to overnight carrier, I am anticipating loosing |||1
or forgetting it somewhere. |||1
Every roller bag sold should have strap like this - always keep mine close at hand and use it all the time! |||1
If you're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together, this is not the strap to use. Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker, Black, One Size.This simple buckle and strap |||1
looks easy to use but it isn't. When you're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap, you're fussing around with it in baggage claim. |||1
The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra "tongue" to quickly pull on (like a backpack strap) so you can clip, pull to tighten, and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good |||1
for light loads and smaller bags. For larger ones, this one was a pain to use. You get what you pay for. Choke up the extra $5 and get the |||1
Travelon, you'll be glad you did. |||1
It takes up very little space when not being used, but has worked great in making it much easier to movie two pieces of luggage with one hand.My only caution |||1
is be sure that you snap the pieces together as they were intended to be snapped together. If you snap together with the one piece upside down, you'll need pliers |||1
to get them apart. So watch what you're doing and don't be stupid . . . or careless. And don't ask whether it was me or not who was stupid |||1
or careless. |||1
We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip. They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into |||1
taxis & B & Bs, etc. They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one |||1
thing together for easy carrying). I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed |||1
and lost. |||1
I bought two of these, and we have used them both multiple times. They are made well and the clip is heavy duty. Make sure to use it with a |||1
strong handle on your suitcase, as the design is such that it pulls significantly on the handle when carrying the second suitcase. This item is also useful to attach other |||1
items, such as on small carryons or your travel pillow. Two of these belts were VITAL to my international travel alone with a toddler and tons of suitcases/stroller/carryons/car seat, etc. |||1
They helped to strap items together for easy transport, and I was able to get through the airports with everything in tow. I highly recommend them!UPDATE FEB 2012: I have |||1
used these straps on multiple trips and they have held up well. At one point I used the strap on three suitcases at once, including a large rolling duffel bag, |||1
a large suitcase, and a medium suitcase. It kept everything together and I was able to navigate through international airports with multiple suitcases strapped together, car seat, diaper bag, backpack, |||1
and toddler (in an Ergo baby carrier). Without this strap, I don't know what I would have done! Such a little product, and so important!!! |||1
The Inflatable buzz lightyear costume jet pack did arrived on time. My son did like it but it did not last long. It was OK gift for my son. |||1
Very fast shipping!Inflates easily and stayed inflated well.The elastic harness Velcros, so it's safe and it's gives a small 1/4" adjust-ability to their size.They do stick out quite a bit |||1
from the sides of the child, but I think it adds to the excitement for the child.a lot of fun, The material is the same as that as a blow-up |||1
pool, so there is some durability, but seriously you have to expect that it can easily be punctured just the same if you are not careful. |||1
This jet pack is easy to inflate, and my son can put it on himself. I like that it's inflatable, so my son can wear it as long as he |||1
wants, and then when it's time to take off, I can just deflate it, fold it up, and put it in my purse. The only problem we've encountered is that |||1
it rides up pretty high on my son's back, above his shoulders, so he keeps pulling it down lower, but it won't stay. It's pretty durable for an inflatable. My |||1
son crashes into things, the dog has stepped on it, but it still works. |||1
plastic is a little fragile, but it will probably last as long as his attention, my grandson just loved it |||1
My nephew loves this . Wore it for Halloween and played Buzz at home for weeks afterward. A terrific item. |||1
This is a blow up wings. The strings to wear them are very small for my 3 year old, so I don't know how someone bigger could use them. Ours |||1
has already got a hole in it. It's cute, and big, but not very durable. |||1
Ordered this as an accessory to the Buzz Lightyear costume my Son wanted to wear for Halloween. Was easy to inflate and put on. However, there is a pretty heavy |||1
chemical smell that comes off the item - not sure if it's from the materials it's made with or from the coloring on the jet pack. Rating would have been |||1
5 stars if not for the smell. |||1
I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume. Unfortunately, when we blew up the jet pack the |||1
day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour, it began to deflate quickly. We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that |||1
it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material. Luckily, I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in |||1
my city which held up fine on Halloween. |||1
My son loves this. We had one before but after a year of being banged around they died, which is acceptable. So we got a replacement for him. |||1
These were great for my son's halloween costume. Looks fantastic. They are inflatable - I don't know if you can tell that from the picture. You have to get them |||1
really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should. My chief complaint is how the straps (very thin 1/4" elastic) are attached to the jet |||1
pack. It looks like they will break loose any moment. Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself, but I don't expect this to stand up to much more. It |||1
did look great with the costume, though!!! |||1
We bought these wings to go with the Buzz Lightyear deluxe costume, and it really made the costume whole! They are inflatable so some care is needed but we have |||1
had them for a year and a half now and my son still uses them for "super hero" play time. Great buy, would recommend to anyone buying the deluxe costume |||1
for a great and i believe necessary add on. |||1
My boys are very much into the superhero stage, and these were perfect!! They are inflatable back pieces, with white elastic straps similar to a backpack style. The great thing |||1
is no one gets injured from being whacked with the wings of these mid-flight. (as one who got smacked in the face while my Buzz was off to save the |||1
galaxy, I can vouch for that). Price was great, these are super fun! |||1
I'm an adult so obviously it was a bit small but it was good for a costume. Not the best quality if you want something durable. It is still in |||1
one piece though, after a party. |||1
I purchased my Suunto in 2005 (not from Amazon) and wore it daily from then until 2013. It has good to combat twice, multiple airborne jumps, and EVERYTHING! I had |||1
to replace the band once during this time (loctite my friends, loctite) and the battery just a few times. I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and |||1
considered getting another Suunto, the Core, however, the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector. When I was stationed with the |||1
Special Forces, this watch was an issued time piece, and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then. I wasn't deploying at that time, so I purchased mine |||1
since everyone else had one. The face is large (52mm) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off, however, the watch has never failed me. I seldom use |||1
the Compass or other functions, but when I did, they where dead on. Actually, one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and |||1
it was dead on. Also, when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up, it was dead on as well. Actually, when doing land navigation testing, these watches aren't |||1
allowed because you have an advantage. In all, I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down. When it does, I will stick |||1
with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core. The price has gone up since 2005, in which I paid $150.00 via an eBay sale, those |||1
days are apparently long gone. I've gone swiming, and even light diving and had no issues. The alarm works well, and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you |||1
don't have to worry about shorter months, leap years, blah blah blah. A solid product. If you know someone who is in the military have them purchase it for you |||1
because they are cheaper on military bases.My only advice would be to get some loctite to reinforce the screws. You can take it to a locale jewler and they can |||1
perform this service for you, likely for free. |||1
I don't know how many vector series watches I have bought. It is the basic Suunto model but it has everything that I need, not only for everyday use but |||1
for my job in the military. |||1
This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch. It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I |||1
like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are.The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap |||1
year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). |||1
Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch |||1
alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this.The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m |||1
above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but |||1
a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it.The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling |||1
trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode).The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the |||1
wrist.The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget |||1
to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and |||1
greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass.The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to |||1
accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to |||1
a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, |||1
readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not |||1
great.Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter. |||1
Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big. |||1
It does everything I need a watch to do and it looks good too. I have several of these watches in different colors, and since the battery is so easy |||1
to change I do it myself. which saves money. |||1
To my way of thinking, there are only TWO factors which keep the Vector from receiving a full 5-stars here. #1 is the watch face. It is not very durable. |||1
It isn't even glass. It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic. I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, |||1
but this one takes it to a whole new level. I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of |||1
being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it. You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone |||1
ELSE is taking a hot shower. The humidity alone may cause problems. Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull |||1
off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite |||1
well in a variety of areas. It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need |||1
to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude. I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by |||1
folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit |||1
high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all |||1
Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings. If Casio add's one to their model, I'll |||1
probably become a full-time convert. If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer. It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, |||1
so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one |||1
of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use). |||1
Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot). Over the years the watch has |||1
taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch. The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well. Battery |||1
replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year). The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job. |||1
Amazing watch which I use on a daily basis. The time is large and is easily read and the date is just below that which is very useful in my |||1
job. The altimeter and barometer work great once they are calibrated correctly. Easy to use watch with three alarms that can be set quickly. The watch fits well and is |||1
very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. |||1
I've bought this one and works perfectly, but I've changed it for a X-Lander with Aluminium case, wich one is perfect. |||1
I expected a lot more from a "wrist computer" selling for almost 250.00, and the Military version for $300. First of all the visibility of the display is much too |||1
dark. The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising. Secondly, the instructions |||1
to set the numeric values (meters vs feet, etc.) aren't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch, you have to download the full set of instructions to |||1
figure that out, then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations, that even with 20/20 vision, I had to |||1
use an illuminated magnifying glass to see, then set the values. Thirdly, the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight. It is only good for pitch black |||1
darkness...much too dim, but is probably the same as their military version, which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot! Fourth, (probably for |||1
the same reason) the alarm is not loud enough, especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing. As others have stated, it should not |||1
be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep. Fifth, the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable...too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you |||1
also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass (which, as it turns out, I do carry while trekking). Finally, the feature navigation is not intuitive, meaning if you |||1
do not use the features and sub-features regularly, good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed, and turned on and off, unless you carry the instructions on |||1
your person.I am going to keep this "wrist computer" for trekking, but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use. That honor will still go |||1
to my Wenger Military. Because of that, there should be a way to shut off the X-Lander (short of removing the battery) so the battery does not run down while |||1
it's in the safe...still hoping to find out how to do that...doesn't have a stem to pull out like a watch.I can not recommend the X-Lander. It is feature-rich, fairly |||1
compact and lightweight, but the issues above make it less than desirable and overpriced. The Finns need to address these issues before I buy another Suunto "wrist computer". |||1
I've had this watch for several years now and it still holds up. It is a little pricier than some of the competition from Casio and Timex. However, it offers |||1
some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on |||1
the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic |||1
time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - |||1
easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good |||1
water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and |||1
a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement |||1
is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too |||1
hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume |||1
the other Suunto models are also good. Serves me well. |||1
I collect watches, and I am NOT one to shy away from big watches, and in some cases, the bigger the better. What I really love about the X-Lander is |||1
that it is big but also very light-weight. Normally when you see a wrist watch this large you have to exercise your arm quite a bit just to get used |||1
to telling time, but not so with the X-Lander. And best of all: it does WAY MORE than just tell time!Interested in knowing where you are going? How about the |||1
current temperature? Are you just the slightest bit interested in what your current altitude may be? GO BUY THIS WATCH! 'Course for those Suunto enthusiasts, this ISN'T a watch, its |||1
a Wristop Computer that just so happens to be able to tell time. Unlike the Suunto Observer which is about half the size (and more than a little extra spendy), |||1
this baby will do all that and still look great doing it. From the 3 different Suunto models I personally own, I must admit that they make a great wristop |||1
computer, or for the picky out there, watch. I mostly use mine to tell simple time, but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana |||1
or over to Oregon and Washington, it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist. Oh, I almost forgot the barometer! It tracks |||1
the barometric pressure and helps you track and even predict the weather! I must say that I haven't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do |||1
that just yet, but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw, I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with isn't all |||1
that bright, and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer. Other than |||1
these minor complaints, I whole-heartedly endorse pretty much everything manufactured by Suunto, and especially the models I own, the X6HR, The Observer and of course the X-Lander. Sylish, multi-functional and |||1
quite durable. Choose one of these models and you will no doubt be as satisfied as I am. |||1
GREAT!!! Service, I got excately what I ordered and received it in 4 days! I recommend'em and will to my friends and family as well.. |||1
This watch screams high-tech, and anyone venturing off to a comic book convention is bound to get a few nods from people dressed in Sith Lord garb and even a |||1
wicked witch or two.So it's big, real big, but cool. If you want a little more discreet, go with the Observer.The new synthetic band that has replaced the leather is |||1
a real improvement. After all, whoever heard of a sports watch with a leather band? The idea is absolutely absurd. HOWEVER, the back eyelit got chafed and worn away the |||1
first two weeks. Of course, it doesn't show, but it's annoying, especially considering this isn't an el cheapo watch.If you're into mountain biking, running, swimming, hiking, or training of any |||1
sort, this is the watch for you. It doesn't have super sports specific functionality, but in my experience I've never used stuff like that in any case, so this watch |||1
accomodates me perfectly.And women DROOL over it. Well, sorta. |||1
I purchased the X-Lander Military version of this watch (all black, rubber strap). I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches. I love the |||1
compass and reverse display. You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer. The elevation data seems |||1
to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS. My chief complaint is |||1
that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place). |||1
This was for my grandson for Halloween and he loved it. He is a huge spider man fan. He look great in it. |||1
I ordered this for my son, who was invited to a Superhearo party. He has been in a solid size 6 and sometimes goes up to a 7. I think |||1
this costume runs a bit small. It fit him perfectly but if he wore a 7, I think it would be too tight.The costume is of average durability. Parents used |||1
to ordering these types of costumes will find it average. If I had to wash this every week, it might not make it past 6 months.I didn't order any gloves |||1
to go with this, he wanted them but didn't need them. Unless it's a chilly Halloween night, save your $ and skip the gloves as well.Overall my son loves this |||1
costume. He's not a fan of the velcroe back. it bothers him, so we leave the back open, he's usually wearing a shirt underneath anyway.We were going to a party |||1
in the spring. The costume is quite warm. The material is thin but the overall effect left him overheated in the sun. Please keep this in mind if you're using |||1
the costume in a warmer climate.It is a good value for the price. |||1
Yelp, I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play. It is really cheaply made. It's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 |||1
bucks. And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it doesn't give them a place to breath out of . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so don't |||1
pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume |||1
this is a great costume. size is true. i ordered it with the matching gloves. great gift for little boys who love spiderman |||1
It was a big hit with my 4 yr. old. He loved it. It fits perfectly with room for growing. The price was really good too. |||1
Good lock, I use this for my gym locker and it serves it's purpose. I like that the color stands out so i don't have a hard time finding my |||1
locker(: |||1
Yes, this is a good lock especially for the money. But I had to laugh when I realized I could not enter my own combination numbers.....the maker actually gives you |||1
the combination you have to use on your lock and then you get to memorize THEIR numbers.....how stupid are we getting?? |||1
This lock does the job when I go to the gym. It feels pretty cheap though. They dont make them like they used too.I am more concerned with not unlocking |||1
vs someone breaking it. |||1
Master Lock has been around for a really long time. I purchased because of the name, the sturdiness of the lock and the color. Easy to spot which locker is |||1
mine amoungst the dozens, most sporting boring black locks. |||1
Always a smooth, easy to use lock. Great for lockers and standard uses. I wouldn't put it on my bike, too easy to cut, but for lockers at school, the |||1
gym. Great lock. |||1
For the price, I think this is a fine costume. No more cheaply made than the next Halloween costume but because it's so simple, you can't really tell. It was |||1
a hit at the party I attended (I went with someone dressed in a priest costume made by the same company - great couples' idea)! It would earn an extra |||1
star if it came with the cross. I had to buy one for another ten bucks at the last minute. |||1
I have a friend and she is not dating for a few years untill her child goes to college.She said I feel like Im a nun now so I sent |||1
this to her. She laughed her ass off. |||1
As it turns out, I didn't have a chance to use the costume but it seems to be well made. Look forward to using it another time. |||1
Happy with it. Good value for the money an would recommend it to someone who is looking to purchase one. |||1
This came fast and it's of great quality! Perfect for the price, a little better actually. I am going to enjoy this ;)Happy Halloween! |||1
I love this. It was cheap, and it is super cute and the kids just adore it. Anything to do with Dora is always a hit, and they felt like |||1
it was similar to her backpack... |||1
Great for a toddler, perfect size for the little ones. Durable and no chocking worries at all. Enough in the purse to role play and hold interest great price too! |||1
I bought this for my 2 year old cousin. She has a habit of taking her mothers purse and walking all over with it so I figured it would be |||1
perfect. When I first saw it I fell in love with the soft material and girly colors and she absolutely loves it. She always remembers to put her things in |||1
her purse so she can be "just like mommy." |||1
This purse is very cute and my 15 month old g-daughter loves it. It's her favorite purse of the two she has. |||1
I bought this for little 2 year old for Christmas & she loved it. The price was fair too!!! I will probably buy from this company again. |||1
This is a fun little purse for a toddler. It's a manageable size and comes with fun things inside. Just wish the steps were a bit longer. |||1
i love it its cute my daughter plays with it she feels like a little lady with it . . |||1
my 2 year old daughter loves this product! she is not crazy about the purse which is pretty small but she really likes the things that come with it. I |||1
wish the phone would have been made to work with batteries, so it would make a noise or something but it is just a piece of plastic with fake buttons. |||1
My 15 month old daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it. I wish the phone buttons could be pushed or did something. Other than that, it is a |||1
fun toy and she walks around the house carrying her handbag just like mommy. Too cute! |||1
I purchased this purse for my daughter who is almost 2. She loves playing with all the parts and I gave her some additional cards to put in the purse. |||1
Better than some of the other sets I found online. |||1
My 20-month old granddaughter loves to go through Mommy's purse so I was sure she would love this one - but not so. The phone doesn't do anything and doesn't |||1
look mom's smart phone, the mirror is tiny, the credit card wallet is hard too open. Mostly, the things just aren't 'real' enough to match what Mom has. It was |||1
tossed in a corner after the first day and hasn't been used since. |||1
My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces. Since the pieces were sealed in a bag, it was a clearly |||1
problem from the manufacturer. When we went to exchange it, we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors! Pretty bad quality control, if |||1
you ask me. We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy... pretty dissapointing. |||1
"What is thaaaat?!?" That was the shriek exclaimed by my 2.5 y/o when she opened this up on Christmas! She is so super excited about this purse set... She loves |||1
the credit card, phone and "Chapstick (lipstick)" the most. The size of the enclosed items are. Perfect for a toddler. The price was really good, too. We are definitely very |||1
happy with this purchase. Oh, for those who may care, the mirror that came with her set was yellow vs the shown blue, just FYI. |||1
I haven't opened it yet but it looks really cute.fast delivery also!cant wait to give it as a gift to my 2 year old shes going to love it! |||1
I bought this for my friend's three year old daughter and she absolutely adored it. It's been about a month since then and my friend said her daughter still can't |||1
leave the house without it! For the money, this gift is perfect! |||1
very nice first purse for a little girl. My granddaughter will love it, I am saving it to give to her for Easter. |||1
My niece loves this little purse with all the items that go in it. She walks around caring her little purse just like her mom's. |||1
My kids liked this and have fun playing around with it, the only thing I felt was the price could have been better. Saw it much cheaper at Walmart not |||1
too long ago and then believe it or not at the dollar store.However, the product itself is durable and nice, not kids hazards jumping right out or frail designs. |||1
This is adorable. The fabric of the purse is nice and soft and the little items inside are cute. I like the size of it as well. Not too large, |||1
not too small. My granddaughter will love it. |||1
The child I gave it to loved it, she carries it around all the time. Cool toy for the Mommy mini me girly girl. |||1
This is pretty cute for the price. A bit cheaper in quality than the small picture makes it look, but for the price, it serves it's purpose. My 2 year |||1
old niece loves it! |||1
My daughter wanted a toy cell phone, (911 dispatchers probably wouldn't agree its a good toy, but oh well) so I got to looking and I got this set for |||1
just a little more than just a phone would have cost. She loves all of it and carries it around the house, she just turned 4. Great product for the |||1
price, I would recommend it. |||1
Bought for my 15 month old Granddaughter. She thinks it's great. I think her favorite piece is the fake lipstick. It's worth buying. |||1
I haven't actually gotten to see the product, but I got a call from my sister-in-law and she told me how much her daughter loves her first purse. She said |||1
she carried it quite often and that it was a perfect gift for a 3 or 4 year old girl! |||1
My neice loves it. She really likes the cell phone. She is so cute with her little purse! She loves the little mirror in it. |||1
My granddaughter loves it & all the adorable goodies inside it.She carries it everywhere with her and happily plays with the accessories. |||1
I bought this when I saw it on Amazon. I also bought a book (Lillie's Purple Plastic Purse) to go along with it as a gift for my 2 year |||1
old niece. Lots of fun for a little girl. |||1
I sent this to my granddaughter for Christmas and never heard back or got a thank you or even if my granddaugter received it. I am only guessing that it |||1
was all that it was suppose to be. Since I had it sent to myself and I wrapped and sent it to them myself I did get a look at |||1
it from outside the box. It looked pretty good quality to me and I would have bought it for my daughter when she was little if they had it then, |||1
I would still recommend it as a nice gift as it came in a very sturdy box and everything looked like fun to me. |||1
My daughter had one of these when she was a toddler. It was really sweet and she loved carrying it around and taking the stuff out. I ended up buying |||1
one for my step-grandaughter this Christmas. She was thrilled with it and just like my daughter used to do, she had a blast pulling everything out, going through it and |||1
putting it all back in. Everything is easy to hold, fun to look at, and just grown-up enough to make them feel like this really is their own purse. |||1
My daughter was in love w/this for about 5 mins (she's 2)...then she threw everything all over the place & never looked at it again. Maybe I'll put it away |||1
& regift it to her next year. |||1
I got this for my 17month granddaughter. She enjoys the toy. She really likes the phone and lip stick. I think she will enjoy even more as time goes on. |||1
My daughter likes this toy, I was disappointed that the little pink phone didn't have push buttons. Other than that the toys is cute. |||1
I was in a hurry and needed an easy little gift for a one year old's birthday. It does say on the tag that it is for 2+ but the |||1
pieces inside weren't too terribly small. It came in the mail quick with prime so generally I'm happy and so was the kid. Win win! |||1
My twin cousins loved this! They are not yet two but said "ohhhh" and sighed like they were so elated :) |||1
This was so much fun for my niece, a two year old. She liked the items so she could be "just like mommy". She loved the purse for other items |||1
as well, like carrying her other precious things. Nice little toy gets a lot of use. |||1
This is a great little purse, and my daughter still plays with it a year later. The design is very cute, but the phone could be better (like if numbers |||1
could actually be pressed and perhaps sounds made). When you put all the accessories in the bag, it is pretty full and barely closing. But my daughter has since found |||1
a better phone to put in her purse, along with the rest. |||1
got for my niece and she had a blast with it. the only bad this is that the little parts all get lost and now she does not have half |||1
of them. |||1
.....this was purchased for my daughter for her first birthday. It's very cute, and I can see her playing with it a bit more as she gets older. Right now |||1
she's more into the "take the stuff out of the purse and put it back in" stage, but still......a neat little toy for the lil miss in your life! |||1
It's very durable, perfect for your "little princess". Now my 2 year old princess is using it, and loves it, now she has her bag /phone and make-up too! So |||1
cute! |||1
We bought this for our 15-mo old granddaughter. She liked carrying it around. She played with the "Phone" and the "keys" that came with it and "used" the lipstick. I |||1
liked that the handle was soft and the purse was a good size for toddlers. I'm sure she will continue to enjoy it over the next few years. |||1
My twin girls got this when they turned two and they both love it and still have it at almost 3 1/2. My only complaint is the little plastic card |||1
holder. For some reason, neither of the girls can open it. But overall, they love the purse and it's lasted this long with very destructive twins! |||1
My oldest daughter, who is now 5 years old, got one of these purses a couple of years ago from my mother. Out of all of the toys that my |||1
daughters have, this is the one that they would fight over the most, so for my youngest daughter's 3rd birthday I got her her very own "First Purse". They both |||1
love playing with all of the included accessories, and often throw in a few additional items of their own. The purses and accessories are all very durable, in fact, I |||1
had to put my daughters' initials on everything because I really can't tell the difference between the new items, and the items that we've had for a couple of years |||1
already. Out of all of the little purses that I've looked at online and everywhere else, I definitely feel like this is the cutest and best deal out there. |||1
bought this for our daughters 2nd birthday and she loves it. its great for any little girls "first purse" :) |||1
I gave this as a gift for the daughter of a friend. I was not able to check the age requirement but it turns out, the gift was still a |||1
hit, especially the cellphone. This is a good buy. |||1
My daughter is 1 and loves to play with this purse. She takes the items out and outs them back in. She also tries to talk on the phone and |||1
thinks the debit card is fun to carry around. |||1
SHE ESPECIALLY LOVED THE LIPSTICK & PASSED IT AROUND THE TABLE. IT WA SO CUTE WATCHING HER JOY FINDING ALL THAT WAS IN THE PURSE. GOOD BUY GRANDMA |||1
I got this for my two year old granddaughter...she loved it...it is safe and the different objects in the purse are very appealing. |||1
I bought this for a gift for the neighbor and it was perfect - she was turning 2 and was just starting to get into her mom's purse. |||1
My first purse is very sturdy and nice for any little girl developing into a big girl. I love it. |||1
Bought this for a baby in the family, she loves real purses so I had to buy her the baby version! she loved it. |||1
Great watch, extremely light, nice sinister metal color. I'd rate it as more than acceptable for dress wear. My friends are green eyed envious and want one. My only question |||1
is why doesn't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face? I can't believe that one reviewer was upset that the watch crystal wasn't as bullet proof |||1
as the titanium watch case and band. |||1
I've owned two of these watches now. It is by far the best watch I've ever had. It is so light you don't feel it on. It's great if you |||1
are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has |||1
a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work. The face is also smaller than most comparable watches. About 1/2 way |||1
between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch. I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason. |||1
It is fairly scratch resistant. I am very abusive with my watches. I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water. I do a lot of |||1
hands on woodwork etc. I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face. Under normal use I suspect it would |||1
not get too scratched up. The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something. The pins have never bent or come out, ever! I |||1
think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium. It don't know for certain but given the fact they've |||1
never come out I assume so. Titanium is much stronger than steel. The band itself is very smooth and comfortable. It never pinches the skin or feels irritating. The reason |||1
why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or |||1
more of pavement after an initial hard impact. That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came |||1
off. The hands were still good. If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it. I |||1
paid $100 for it both times. Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this |||1
one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it. You will not be disappointed if you buy this watch. You will seriously be saving money because |||1
it is nearly indestructible and you won't lose it if you never take it off because the band doesn't ever break or come off the watch. |||1
Son's had his for 3-4 years. My 18 yr old son liked his so much. He even got compliments on it. Just bought another as a gift. It arrived in |||1
a frosted plastic display cube - looks nice. Good price for this watch. |||1
Wow! I paid $67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago! I was shocked to see that the current price is $112.50. It's a great watch |||1
at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95. The links are truly a bear to remove. I suspect that the |||1
link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links. You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather |||1
than from the outside edge of the band. |||1
Bought this for my husband-great watch. However, we had to take to a jeweler to remove links. Lightweight-goes with everything. |||1
The baby loves his little Dora bag, but why they can't make some of this stuff in blue or grey or any other color is beyond me. |||1
I wish I had the camera out when our little girl first saw her Backpack. Her face lit up. She was so excited. She also loved 'Map'. Our girl is |||1
a small 1yr 9months, so the straps are a little big. Aside from it being a little too big on her back, Backpack keeps our girl entertained. She really likes |||1
putting things into it. I'd highly recommend this for every little Dora fan. |||1
The bag is great. The map seems to be a little cheap. It's connected to a small piece of rope. The map is hard for my 3 year old to |||1
roll up & Velcro back together.. Otherwise, the bag is sturdy. |||1
Bought this backpack for my daughter to carry her Dora books in and it fits. But the weight of the 2 books made the magnet snap pop off constantly. I |||1
think it would be fine if you don't put anything inside the backpack, but if you want to put books in there like my daughter, then you would have to |||1
sew on your own snap or button. Cute! |||1
Nice quality,my daughter loves it to wear to her preschool! She has it on her back all the time!I don't want her to outgrow this any soon!!The quality & finish |||1
is great!highly recommend!! |||1
The kids just love this. Why---no clue. I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter, so I ordered 2---one for my daughter as well. |||1
We live in the caribbean, where it's hot, so a thick plush backpack is something you don't want to have on your back. The color is cute too, but I |||1
can see it easily getting soiled. I didn't let this backpack out of the house, and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes |||1
attached to it though. The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure. Good size. |||1
Hard to beat the price but I didn't expect that Casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing. I gave the watch away a day after I got |||1
it. |||1
I needed an everyday digital watch that I can wear to classes and gym. This one does the job very well at its kind price (can find at a cheaper |||1
price online) and looks good as well. It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face. I have a relatively thin wrist (Sz 6.5) so |||1
it looks proportional. I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway. It even looked a little |||1
small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little |||1
weak. It's extremely easy to change the battery too. Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back, take out the watch inside (it's one piece), open it by opening four |||1
corners, swap the battery, then put it back together. Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch, you will figure out easily.Overall, I'm very satisfied.The only |||1
con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter. But no problem reading the time. |||1
The buttons aren't overly sensitive (problem with my old watch), good fit, easy to use. I highly suggest to anyone. |||1
These watches go forever. If you do not use the light or stopwatch, the battery can last for years. The band is the only thing that has ever broken on |||1
mine and a band cost almost as much as the watchYou can wash your hands or get caught in the rain and not worry about the watch since it is |||1
water resistant |||1
Got it for my bf and he likes it. The lap feature in particular is nice. Other than that it's just a good, basic watch. The watch face was a |||1
little smaller than I expected, but nothing wrong with that. |||1
Love it.it's a bit edgy and bothering at first but soon its very comfortable.does it job.Considering buying? You should. |||1
I need a watch to carry in my pocket, most pocket watches are too large, but by removing the strap and ancillary parst from this watch it does the job |||1
very well; to only negative is the instructions that come in teeny-tiny print requiring a magnifying glass which is very irritating |||1
I wanted a watch to wear when working in the yard, this fits the need. I had to go on line to find out how to change the time, but |||1
that was easy. |||1
I thought it would be a bit bigger, but it was not. I'm keeping it anyway, it does the trick. It's also on the small side around my wrists. |||1
I have had many big fancy watches and have settled on the Casio F-91W Casual Sport Watch.It's light, cheap, super accurate, and easy, intuitive to operate. You don't need a |||1
manual to set time or alarm. No need for those big clunky heavy watches to bang around. Those timepieces are just silly. |||1
Worked for a while. Then it broke. Or maybe I lost it. But for 10 bucks who cares. This is the kind of watch you get before a trip where |||1
you don't want to risk losing, breaking or having stolen your real watch. Might also work as a kid's first watch but it might not hold up to kid-level abuse. |||1
It's cheap (in cost) because it's a cheap watch. So there you go. |||1
this watch should just be for a woman's waist. It is really a small watchactually gave it to my 15 year old Grand-Daughter |||1
It works well and gets the job done. I have a small wrist and it fits like a glove. I love the stopwatch (although I keep forgetting it. Completely recommend! |||1
I wear my high-top chucks until they have holes everywhere so I know my size and style. These were cheaper than the chucks on the converse website so I took |||1
a chance and am happy that I did. They are the same ones I get every time, perfect size, perfect fit. They are just as comfy as always, needing only |||1
one double-socked wear to break them in. I love them.  |||1
I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I |||1
thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do. Sigh. But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up |||1
the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes. One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, |||1
and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself. |||1
So wonderfull I liked a lot and I will purchase it whenever I will need it and I received alot of comment of it. |||1
Product came on time, was exactly as described, were the correct size and the correct color. I had no problems with this order. When I was going through the reviews, |||1
I noticed quite a few complaints, and was worried. I needed new sneakers and figured 40 bucks was not all that bad for the shoes. I used to wear Chucks |||1
until they fell apart, and will probably do the same with these. |||1
My daughter had me order the for her for her first year in high school. They arrived as expected, fit perfectly, and she's happy. It doesn't get much better than |||1
this! |||1
This is a great high quality pair of shoes. The canvas is high quality and the stitching looks good. The inside of the shoes are also great. Buy chucks here |||1
for $20 ish less than at other places. Also make sure to buy a half or a full size smaller than what you normally wear. If you get these in |||1
the correct size you won't be dissapointed! If you found this review helpful please make sure to hit the helpful button to help others see this too. Thanks! |||1
It's not bad, but it's kind of cheap leather and doesn't seem to wear very well. I've worn them for a year or so and they still squeak and feel |||1
pretty cheap. They're a little bit large, coming from someone that has had many, many pairs of Converse. |||1
I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily, are confortables, the color is durable. Their |||1
friends have liked it. I recommend it |||1
Bought for my granddaughter, they are too cute. cant wait to see her to give them to her. They are really cute and the color is perfect |||1
I work with a friend who is the biggest Chuck Taylor fan of all time. She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks (over 20), and always seems to |||1
wear a different color every day. So to be a good friend, I had to get a pair. Red, being one of my favorite colors, seemed the right choice. I |||1
bought size 6.5 Men's, which translates to 8.5 Women's. The fit is good! These are heavier than I would have expected, but they aren't uncomfortably so. They are very sturdy |||1
considering so much of them is made from canvas. My feet feel well supported. While I probably won't go bonkers over them, I might have to invest in a second |||1
pair. |||1
They say that "it takes a real man to wear pink", but even among women and girls who wear Converse, pink is an uncommon color. These make quite a statement |||1
no matter what crowd you run with. In some ways it can even be a safety measure, as they make you easy to identify in a multitide. Because they are |||1
so unique, people that wouldn't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes |||1
these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition, unlike many shoes, Converse don't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning (just avoid the bleach, or |||1
you'll fade them quite fast). Thus, I don't mind wearing these everywhere, because if they get dirty it's no big deal.Speaking of fading, pink Converse have to be worn for |||1
awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright, deep pink than they appear. They are not "neon pink" (a separate and |||1
easily distinguished color), but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger, and these are no exception. So if you're a 9.5, get a |||1
9, etc. These were my very first pair, and I'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a |||1
rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse, these have little to no arch support, a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes (i.e. you'll feel it if you step on |||1
a rock or such), and don't take too kindly to being worn in the rain, mud, snow, etc. I certainly wouldn't run a mile or take a hike in them. |||1
For those reasons, I've got to knock one star, as much as I otherwise love these shoes. |||1
I bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loved them . They are very comfortable and help to support her ankles when she goes walking . great price was |||1
helpful in purchase . recommend this product . |||1
Order a size,up..always with this style and brand as my son has bought several pairs and loves them.good quality..arrived on time well packaged |||1
what can i say stylish and comfortable black goes with everything,my husband has many pairs in assorted colors he likes the so much |||1
I purchased these for my daughter's hip hop dance competition routine. Pricey but very good quality. All white. These are stated in men's sizes so be sure to convert to |||1
women's. For example, men's 3 is women's 5. There is a chart listed either by seller or on Converse website for reference. These worked out well and hopefully get to |||1
use next year for the competition routine so we can get return on our investment. $70! |||1
These are RADICAL! These are really hot with black jeans . Buy one size smaller than you normally buy shoes, these run large. |||1
The title says it all. I loved these, but you literally have to wrestle your kid and near mangle his feet, even when a size or two too big- to |||1
get them on. THEN you have to lace and tie them! On a kicking toddler! Yeah, right! IMPOSSIBLE to get on for the most part. And don't seem comfortable either. |||1
they need to create this same shoe, but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side, down to the toe bed to get the young child's foot inside. |||1
Simple, comfortable and lightweight shoes. Dense fabric. Good quality rubber, soft sole. I hope that will be pleasantly worn.Delivered in a timely manner. I'm quite happy. |||1
Love my converse! I remember them from high school, and they also ran a half size too big back in the day. Once you get the right size, they're great. |||1
I wear a 8 (womens) and ordered a 5.5 in Men's. |||1
I'm a major Converse fan, I like to collect them in all different colors, why not pink? I already knew my Converse size from the other Chuck Taylor colors I |||1
already owned, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, even though most of my other Converse are low-cut Oxfords. The high-tops can take a little more work to get onto |||1
your feet, but it's worth it I think for the high-top style. And the pink is a nice subdued shade, not a gaudy hot pink or anything like that. Definitely |||1
recommended for both women and men who are secure enough in themselves to go out and about wearing pink Converse. They look great. |||1
I bought these exclusively to be worn for my daughter's Mavis Halloween Costume and they were perfect!! She was comfy for a few hours of trick-or-treating with no issues of |||1
sore feet:) |||1
Man let me tell you, I always wanted a pair of these but I was being cheap and didnt want to spend the money...But as you can see I broke |||1
down and went for it. I searched and searched and I am so glad for Amazon's buyers writing reviews because this is what made me go for it. I read |||1
most all of the reviews to make my determination of size because I made a mistake before because I didn't know to order a size smaller. If you a female |||1
and are buying a pair of Converse you better get a size smaller if the listings say Converse Men. I Love, Love, Love these dang shoes and I love the |||1
fact that now that I know what size to order. The fit is perfect. |||1
Always wanted a Converse but was somewhat indecisive. Now I regret not getting one of these sooner. Awesome! A very good decision. |||1
All star is my favorite brand of tennis because thier durability, thanks for sending it just on time, Im very thankful. |||1
Well made, wider cut than adult version to fit blocky toddler feet and chubby ankles. Completes that old school hip hop everyone wants for their kid. |||1
This was exactly what I was looking for. If you are shopping for this item, you will not be disappointed.Item arrived within 2 days. |||1
i had some converse and long story short i drew on them and they got messed up so i got a new pare and these are perfect. fit good. and |||1
these are mens. ok so these shoes say mens five but really they are a womens 7 i think or 7 and a half! so just go on google and |||1
search what your size is in mens and you can get the mens ones too. they are exactly the same as the womens so ya! i hope this helped |||1
I bought these for my nephew's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted. They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller |||1
to anyone. |||1
ive always been a huge fan of converse but when i received these i was amazed at the quality and look. they fit perfectly and i will wear these so |||1
much! |||1
I bought this product for my Boyfriend, and he loves it. Leather is better than plain cloth. Easy to make it white. Very neat and cool. Perfect with jeans. Casual, |||1
but looks clean. |||1
Got these for my son, as he is a fan of Daniel Tiger, and I thought they could match. He has had them for 6 months, and has worn them |||1
constantly - they are still in great shape, and he gets really good traction. He climbs a lot and runs, and is very confident in these shoes. It appears he |||1
gets good support too, so he looks forward to wearing them. Great product. |||1
Im glad I listened to the advice posted and got a slightly smaller size than usual. I normally were a size 12 and the 11.5 fit perfect ! |||1
We purchased these shoes for the girls in our bridal party as they were wearing Latte dresses. The boys wore black to match their suits. I wore white, and my |||1
husband black.The high-tops were a better choice so short socks could be worn by the ladies and the boys didn't have white socks peeking out under their pant legs' hems.All |||1
arrived quickly and in one large box. |||1
Excellent article.It was what I expected.Excellent Shoe and good service delivery.I am satisfied with the package.I recommend them.My daughter loves it. |||1
My Doctor Who wannabe son asked for this shoes, and he is THRILLED with them. Fit well and look great with a red bow tie and fez. |||1
Always in style, no matter what era! These converse shoes are the exact style I wore in the 80s and my dad wore in the 50s. Now my daughter is |||1
wearing them today. They dont provide any kind of cushion or support, I am so surprised they were actually worn for basketball back in the day. Fashion and color choices |||1
make these shoes a forever classic. |||1
Nice fit, looks like the picture. Delivered promptly, price was excellent. No issues at all would recommend to others. thanks |||1
I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job. This is my shoe w/ a walking insole inside I work it out just fine |||1
and no one notices I have on sneaks! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements. Works great w/ slacks or khaki pants. (make sure if you |||1
are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces) Most dress shoes for ladies are |||1
very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well. The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable. |||1
The ultimate rocker or groupie shoe. So cool and never goes out of style. Wear them with a tux or jeans or a mini-skirt. You cannot go wrong with these |||1
shoes. Great price. In Europe they cost three times more! |||1
Born in the mid 60's and going through the 70's, my mom would always buy me these. Still feels the same to.Every time I wear them, it really takes me |||1
back to those fabulous 70's. |||1
Not black!Like an awful green blackI love converse, but these black ones are just ugly. I don't even want to wear them for they do not match my other black |||1
clothes in the closet.Sucks |||1
They're classic converse - what is there to say!? I've never had a pair, but they fit as I thought they would. They're a little more narrow than I expected, |||1
but that's not really a problem. They fit true to size... I originally got a slightly larger one, but sent it back for my true size. |||1
Just your basic, hi top chucks. I have them in almost every color, and they are a good shoe when you need the ankle support.Will only give 5 stars if |||1
the item goes above and beyond expectations, which is why I only rated 4 stars. . |||1
these shoes are very cute and comfortable realmentes find them at a very affordable price more to give away this Christmas will be the perfect gift for my brother. |||1
Maybe I should have exchanged them for a bigger size, but when I tried them on they fit fine. They were perfect in the length so I thought the sizing |||1
was ok. But after an hour my toes feel pinched and hurt. They look super cute but it is really hard to wear them for any period of time. My |||1
feet are not wide by any means, so it was disappointing to have this issue. |||1
I knew I had the best shoes when my then 10 year old cousin went nuts for my pink hi-tops a few years ago!And he was even more excited when |||1
I gave him the key to my SUV so he could see the new pair of limegreen ones I had just purchased.I think that I wore the pink ones while |||1
travelling in California a few years ago. While we werehaving lunch in Santa Barbara one day, I noticed a store across the street and found some supportsthat allowed me to |||1
do even more walking while on that 2 week vacation. I was in my late fiftiesat the time, and it was fun to see the expressions I got while wearing |||1
those shoes!!! Since Imisplaced the old pink pair, I am now replacing them. My favorite shoe of all time!!!Mary |||1
Harkens back to my youth. I truly love these shoes! Fit perfect, get dirty throw them in the wash. Heck yeah! |||1
These have been a staple in America for decades. They are sturdy canvas that wears extremely well over time. The soles are rubber and glued. After extreme wear, some parts |||1
that are glued can get loosened. Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these. So they can last longer than nearly any shoe. They |||1
make them exactly like they did decades ago, with the same quality, with one caveat, Converse, the iconic American shoes, are now made in China. This may or may not |||1
matter to you. It does matter to me, due to labor practices, and environmental standards, which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes, still made in the USA as |||1
of 2013. I've worn made in USA converse in the past, but never the new China-made ones. On arrival I couldn't tell any difference in the shoe itself, just as |||1
sturdy as ever.On a side note: This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities. My wife saw this color/style on some female singer and had to have them. Lots of |||1
female celebrities buy these "male" high-tops. Which I find interesting, it doesn't look bad at all, but it definitely screams trendiness to me. You can google "celebrity Converse" to find |||1
pictures of the myriad of celebs who don Converse. If you do or do not want to be trendy, is your call, but these are definitely being revived in current |||1
"pop culture". To my wife, that is great, emulating her favorite artist, to me, I wouldn't be caught dead in them due to that reason alone. Although I thought about |||1
buying a matching pair just to confuse her, and be "that" weird matching couple, since pop culture has made them unisex lol.Hope that helps! |||1
I've been wearing Chuckie's since I was a kid(over 40 years!!). Original Chuck Taylor's are the biggest icon ever to hit sneakers, with the same bulletproof looks and simple construction |||1
throughout the years. They might offer zero arch support(easily fixed with a set of insoles), and can wear down a bit faster than newer brands, but there is no denying |||1
that, for the price paid, there's no finer example of what a sneaker is.With all of the new colors available, it has and will always be the king....buy a pair |||1
and find out for yourself why. |||1
Excellent!! They fit my daughter perfectly. They are her second pair . The first pair lasted and lasted !ThAnks for a great pair of shoes ! |||1
you know the shoe and you know the star. the comfort level is the truth and they feel so good and have much style and Profile then as now. I |||1
have bought Chucks all through the years and they are always chill and they got style. real nice, real nice. |||1
Bought these for him and he enjoyed them. Very flexible and easy on your feet. I own a pair of these myself, and although the sole can get scuffed very |||1
easily, it's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit. Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size |||1
before you order onlinel |||1
Got (the white) these for my 7 year old he loves them...they are realy cute and they fit him realy nice...Shoe is 100% and he says they are very comfortable |||1
Cute. Functional, Comfortable, Easy to Clean. My daughter liked the all black design. Exact same quality always delivered by Converse. |||1
I SEND THEM TO MY GREAT NIECE IN LAS VEGAS AND SHE LOVES THEM, EVERYONE KNOWS THE QUALITY OF CONVERSE, I HAVE BEEN WEARING THEM SINCE I WAS A CHILD |||1
MYSELF. |||1
I didn't get my All-Stars on Amazon, but I wanted to write a review. I actually bought mine used on eBay about two years ago in June 2012. Like other |||1
reviews note, they do run large. I normally wear a size 10.5-11, but got a size 10 and they fit comfortably. I bought gray hi-tops with red trim. I initially |||1
got them for dead-lifting back when I trained with weights. Since then, I've been using them for casual wear and they've held up very well. I currently live in northern |||1
New Jersey and these shoes are nice for non-winter conditions. The shoe has eyelet vents, so when there's a lot of rain, snow or slush on the sidewalks, you may |||1
want to go with something else. |||1
I love my black on black converse tennis shoes, straightgangsta! Now this is my style. It goes with any I wearthat's casual or street wear. Thank you. |||1
Arrived in good time, fit like a dream, perfect for the actor playing Gladys Herdman! Just a little pricey but worth it. . |||1
My 13 year old daughter loves this shoe and said it looks even better than displayed. It's very comfortable and the price appeared to be the lowest that we saw |||1
at the time the order was placed. |||1
Get these! They stay on!! Yes they are a pain to get on.. But they stay on... And are super stylish. Good for playing or dressing you little one up |||1
on showing him off! |||1
Bought as a replacement for kid brother. Item as describe! Size is true and recommended for teens since shoe does not go out of style. |||1
Got so many compliments on the color. They look really nice on and are so comfortable. Wore them with my Breast Cancer Awareness shirt and jewlry, and they matched perfectly! |||1
She has long somewhat wide feet and she wears these every damn day. I love that she likes them so much but she never wants to take them off. She |||1
says they are very comfortable. |||1
I remember buying these exact same Chucks for 39.99 not too long ago what happened since then? Other than that, still a great shoe, comfortable and classic. Wear them with |||1
anything anywhere. I did buy my normal size and half a size down but I ended up keeping my normal size. The smaller size did fit but I was more |||1
comfy in my normal size, I don't feel that they run abnormally large. I am now ready to order in pink and green next. I love the high tops, I |||1
never liked how the low tops looked on me, the high tops offer more option and style in my opinion. |||1
They were a tad larger than I expected. Not a big deal. We will keep them a little while longer. I appreciate the expeditious shipping. |||1
They are nice shoes, well made & highly rated, but they were a gift that I bought for my husband... a bit too early. I got them a month in |||1
advance, so my the time he opened them and tried them out to find they were too big, they store selling them through Amazon said they would not do a |||1
refund or exchange. My fault... I was just trying to be on top of things. Will know better next time. |||1
Like:Great look.Dislike:This item weights a ton!Tongue moves around.Insole is so flat, I get sore feet after just 10 minutes walking. |||1
These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort. We like the colors and the look of them. I like the pink ones, because |||1
when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers. I have 2 pairs of the high tops, one pair is 5 years old |||1
and while they are limp and a bit faded, the soles are still in decent condition. I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just |||1
a fantastic pink color, and doesn't seem to be fading fast. My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They don't offer any support and they do run large. But as long |||1
as you aren't doing a lot of walking, they are very comfortable and light weight. I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose. |||1
i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item. |||1
I didn't realize that I was suppose to purchase a whole size down, gave them to someone else and now they don't have my size anymore=-( |||1
My daughter found these at a major department store, the last pair they had and the clerk went to check the sizes and had one 6 and one 8 so |||1
she checked other stores and we could not get any. I came home and looked them up and they were basically the same price and they were sent to my |||1
door. Now for a dance team she needs another pair and I will just order them from here, so easy! Thanks! |||1
While I have to agree that these seemed better years ago, they were still what I was looking for and what I expected. Received quickly and fit well. You can't |||1
beat the classics. |||1
I live by converse. I wear converse everyday. It goes with everything and I love it. I really liked the black one and had always wanted to own one so |||1
I am happy XD |||1
This pair was for my son. All 5 of mine love these shoes and wear them until they are literally in tatters. |||1
Retro shoe, great fit for toddlers with a little extra to room for wide baby feet. Look really cute, good price |||1
I like the shoes but they sent me the wrong color (Kelly green instead of Charcoal) so I had to return them and order the correct color again which is |||1
a somewhat hassle. Shoes runs a bit bigger but not too much; I had to tie the laces a little tighter. They are good looking with reasonable comfort but not |||1
too much arch support. I guess you can say they are a fashion statement and good for short walks. Overall, I like them. |||1
The Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops were a gift that I gave to my Nephew from the Netherlands. This is what he picked out from many possible choices. |||1
They were sent to him and as far as I know he liked them very much. Apparently, they were very popular in Holland. He was 16 at the time and |||1
in high school. |||1
I wore these in the rain , and they did excellent.I love them , ohh an d a FREE pair of shoe laces came along . YAAAY ! |||1
Fit is true to size and she loves them. She is fourteen and they are apparently all the rage. Not good for someone with a wide foot. |||1
Nothing to tell you more about these shoes of what you surely already know. They are great, my favorite ones even because I live in the Caribbean and the canvas |||1
is fresh and my feet don't like sweating... |||1
I wear a size 7M and was leery about ordering one size smaller, but did it and I am very happy. I use orthopedics in-soles which fit inside nicely too. |||1
Very comfortable shoe and quality is excellent. Highly recommend. With Amazon, if the shoe doesn't fit, return it for the right size, but on your initial order I recommend ordering |||1
1 size smaller. |||1
These boots are so comfortable I wear them almost every day, I combine everything. I am very happy with this purchase. |||1
It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped |||1
it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if |||1
you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short. |||1
Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size. They were good enough to send UPS to my door to retrieve the sneakers. I loved them, but they didn't fit the baby. :) |||1
I would highly recommend buying these! |||1
Good fit for my son who has a slender foot. Good colors to choose from.....good fit......all good! Try a pair and see! |||1
My son only wore these shoes once (he's only 2) because they cause so much distress to get on and off, we just don't bother anymore. Why they dont make |||1
a hidden zip for the toddler sizes is beyond me. They're expensive so wait until they're older before buying this type of shoe. |||1
i liked the idea of getting a pair of converse b/c my now fiancee has a pair he wears all the time. i found this pink pair and i love |||1
them. |||1
Excellent quality. |||1
I now have several in white, red, and black... I might just have to get a couple more, you can never have too many shoes |||1
I have always liked Converse All Stars and when I saw the charcoal color I had to have them. The size is good for me. I had a blue pair |||1
(low tops) last year and they were snug on my right foot because of a previous injury. Those were a size 8 so I got these in size 9 and |||1
now no more pain :) . They run narrow in my opinion so if your foot is a bit wide I'd size up. |||1
These are extremely tight, and they are meant to. I have some back problems and often wear these under my regular clothes. They help compress my muscles and help align |||1
everything. By the end of the day, I'm sore but the next day I feel great. Will definitely buy more. |||1
The shirt is fine, good quality, fresh, comfortable, like the picture. It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular... some strip can fall out. I bought |||1
two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT |||1
although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long, I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the |||1
correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve. Wherever, my son loves to wear this tee.(Sorry for my english) |||1
First off, I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday; talk about fast delivery! I was told delivery wouldn't take place until 12/21 - |||1
12/27, so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great. I can't tell you how well it fits as it's a gift |||1
for my son. |||1
both love these shirts.. I get the grey ones for son and white for hubby. They keep the moisture off them when they work and play and a perfect everyday |||1
undershirt. |||1
I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts, also own several each of Under Armour's Tech |||1
T-shirts (0382) and the Loose Gear shirts (0084) - I've written reviews on those as well.Ok, let's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt. It |||1
isn't for everybody. It's tight - a compression fit, the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights, but on your upper body. Not everyone likes or is comfortable with |||1
this fit, and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that, it's a high-quality, great-performing shirt. It provides a lot of muscle support, and wicks sweat from your body |||1
to keep you dry. As I said, not everyone will like the fit, especially at first, but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings. Athletes in competitive |||1
team sports - football, hockey, etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you don't have a perfect body needn't |||1
intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support, regardless of what sport or workout you are into. In fact, if you're just a |||1
little bit soft, it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks. You can always |||1
wear another shirt over it if you're self-conscious, just don't like how it looks on you, or haven't quite burned off enough fat yet. If you have a good physique, |||1
what can I say - you're going to look hot in this shirt. In fact, it's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not |||1
buy this shirt without trying it on first. I usually wear a size XL in the other, looser Under Armour shirts, but had to size up to XXL to be |||1
comfortable in these. They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight. I love this shirt in black, but |||1
there's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you can't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry. |||1
UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat, and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off. I've not had this problem |||1
with any other UA shirts in the line-up, even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat, but it may have something to do |||1
with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch (a lot!). Either way, I haven't taken any chances. |||1
I got two of these shirts in anticipation of the DC summer heat. Got to try them out for the first time today during my morning run. Kept me cool |||1
and wicked away sweat quite nicely. A word of caution, they are a bit sheer, so if you're bashful get a darker color. |||1
I fell in love with Under Armour's products four years ago, and that hasn't changed.They were still a niche brand then, on the edge of coming into their own as |||1
a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ...Gear products are the reason why. They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away |||1
at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I |||1
had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that |||1
means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like |||1
the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that |||1
context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved "Tactical" version |||1
of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster |||1
than cotton. The hold you in place. You are not as hot as some may be while working hard. You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend |||1
that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can. |||1
This shirt feels great at the gym. It limits the outward appearance of sweat, allows for your body to cool off while working hard.. Comfort is key when working out, |||1
and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains. Wonderful shirt |||1
I love UA products and buy only compression fit. I am a medium at 155 lbs. 5'7". I ordered a large and it was way too tight in the armpits |||1
due to the shortness of the sleeves. Hence the reason why UA is now making them with the longer sleeves. I wish they would carry the 3/4 sleeve more. |||1
is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do, other brands or kinds are just not good enough, high quality and low price |||1
is all i need |||1
Great fabric and tight fit. Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall, then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso. This company does not |||1
listen to the customer. |||1
there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I'm not gonna lie... I've tried a few of them to save a little money. but i ended |||1
up being very disappointed every time. then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it. it is such a great line of products, and |||1
very versatile. i use it for hunting, i use it for running, i use it at work. it's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour, |||1
it's going to be a solid product. keep up the great work. |||1
fits true to size i can wear this with anything since it being a darker shade of purple wont stand out as much but still has that color its great |||1
just what i was looking for totally would recommend to anyone! |||1
I got these as a gift for my little sister. She had been wanting a pair of these for a really long time. I was so happy to find them |||1
here on amazon for the cheapest price ;) She absolutely LOVES these and wears them every day. great deal. |||1
My daughter loves converse so the fact that it fit her witout us having to return or try on in the store was a plus - it arrived on time |||1
I love these shoes. True to form, these Converse fit well. I love the brightness of the light orange color. |||1
These fit great and feel great to walk around in. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone for a great shoe for the summer. |||1
My wife loves the shoes, however the size convertion was a little off no biggie, just send 'em back and get the right size. |||1
I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large. |||1
Converse has been making these for as long as my kid has been on Earth and longer and now he's asking for them. He loves them. This is his 4th |||1
pair, each in assorted colors. Nothing to complain about whatsoever. They don't really change much - which is **exactly** the point, right? |||1
Purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She wears them all the time. I may borrow them as well. |||1
I bought these for my grown daughter for Valentine's Day and she loved them! They fit perfectly. Any age would love them.. |||1
My 4 yr old son needed black shoes for a play he was in. I didn't want to buy dress shoes as he would not get any additional wear out |||1
of them. I opted for these black Converse. They were adorable, they fit him well - he is about a size 11 little kids but I ordered the 12 and |||1
they are fine with a bit of growing room. He calls them his "Chucks" and thinks he's cool when he wears them...well, he is pretty cool - he has worn |||1
them several times since the play so overall, it was a good purchase. |||1
Love my new, black converse!!! Nice fit and go well with my new pants!!! Very pleased with the product and delivery!! Thank you!! |||1
Ok the title is based on Julie Sarinana check out her blog and you too will see why. The shoes arrived on time to my girlfriend house. A perfect fit |||1
she said, as she is wearing a mens 4.5 for her 6.5. Strange I know but that how they are listed. I purchased these Converse in White Canvas shoes for |||1
my little asian cutie she is 5'1" and maybe 118lbs. My girlfriend will be wearing these new Canvas Converse at Disneyland. She'll copy the amazing fashion style recommendation in Sincerely |||1
Jules web site. The complete outfit for the day at disney: Tangerine Sweatshirt, Crisp WHITE Roxy Cotton Shorts, Sneakers: White Canvas Converse Chuck Taylors, Sunglasses: Karen Walker. Another great purchase. |||1
Enjoy your All Star White Canvas Shoes. I am sure enjoy my asian cutie wearing hers. |||1
Nice quality, great fit, and a fun pair of shoes that are reflective of my personality. Makes you stand out. |||1
I bought these for my eight year old little sister and she's loving them. She says they are very confortable, very bright and vivid color and loves showing them off. |||1
Her first pair of chucks! I'm a proud sister! Very good buy, arrived pretty quickly as well. Great stiching and laces (came with two pair-black and white) If you're getting |||1
these shoes to work in, I don't recommend. They are made tobe confortable but have very little sole support and the toes are kinda squished so perfect for little feet |||1
(like mine and sister's) I have bought three pairs from this site, very great buy! |||1
They are comfy and flat. I did not want to buy specific weightlifting shoes due to price so ended up with these. They perform well while squatting and lunging though |||1
they do have a small toe box. |||1
These run bigger than normal tennis shoes...my son has only worn these since he was born. We are on our 19th pair and get tons of use out of them!! |||1
El vendedor debe revisar las opciones, Me enviaron unos calzados de recien nacidos y seleccione uno de ninos, mi hijo esta muy molesto. |||1
I have wanted Green chuck taylors for the longest time! I got these right away and loved them! They are the bright kelly green as pictured. I am a women's |||1
7.5 usually, but 7's fit perfectly. I was also really happy with the price this seller had it as. Anywhere else seemed to be $60 or more! Can't complain about |||1
these shoes at all except that I'm worried about getting them dirty! |||1
Love itWas a pr&auml;sentIt was verry NiceEvery BodyLiked itAnd gave onlyCompliment's on the item |||1
I had been wearing converse for years I had them in every single color but never an all white pair lol so I ordered them and they just look amazing |||1
with anything u wear I usually wear a 5.5 in boys I ordered a 4.5 in men's they fit a little big so for next time I'll ordered a size |||1
4.0 overall I live them shipping only took 2 days I would recommend. |||1
I got these to replace a pair of the exact color that I got in 1995. They "mysteriously" disappeared when we moved. I love love these shoes. They are the |||1
classic in a really fun color. |||1
These shoes run so big, and the size is very confusing. I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size, but they won't do that. |||1
I have to send them back, and buy another pair. No thanks. |||1
From high school on, these have been a staple. Nothing much to them, just canvass and a fairly poorly supported insole on a fairly sturdy shoe bottom. Cool and comfortable, |||1
these are the perfect "knocking around" shoes. No delivery issues - came in the two business days promised by Prime. |||1
I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM. |||1
Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lo Top Black Monochrome CanvasI love this Converse, excellent quality and stile looks sexy :) |||1
This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase |||1
Ordered for my daughter for Christmas. Fit perfectly and she loves them. I would easily recommend these to anyone. Great shoes. |||1
These are killer--so cute and comfortable. I recommend for women who don't have a lot of money but want to look chic. Wear them with black or brown or tan--wear |||1
them with anything. |||1
You cant go wrong with Chucks. I have been wearing them for the passed year out here in Afghanistan. They hold up nicely in the rough terrain and keep my |||1
feet cool during the summer months when the temperature reaches 130 F degrees. When I am back in the states, I wear pencil skirts and pumps to the office but |||1
I will never outgrow Chucks. I wear them on the weekends during coffee runs or for grocery shopping. |||1
this sneakers is just what my daughter ask for, the sneaker fit her great. the sizes are true to what they say they are.and converse sneakers last a long time. |||1
it a real good value for these shoe, worth every penny. |||1
If you want Chucks, you're gonna get Chucks. Just be aware that the support in them is pretty poor. Walking in them makes me feel like I have a high |||1
ankle sprain. |||1
Got these for my niece for her birthday. She seems to like them. They fit perfect soooo yeeaah that's it |||1
These were huge for my son. Which is likely on me... we just put them in his closet for next year and bought a second smaller size for this year. |||1
I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew. |||1
I get compliments on these shoes everytime I wear them. The fit perfectly as expected and are very comfortable. If you are considering whether to purchase them or not, DO |||1
IT! You won't regret it. They also make a good gift for all ages. These shoes are timeless. |||1
Okay I love everything Converse. I already had pairs of Converse in sizes that fit me, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, I ordered the size that all my |||1
other Converse are, and it fit me well.The green color is just awesome though, lots of people have commented on them. I like Converse in every color, but the greens |||1
are probably one of my favorites.If you like Converse All-Stars and you like the color green, then go for it. |||1
I chose gray/white, they look & feel great. I wear them all the time, and of course they get a little dirty. |||1
zapatos de excelente calidad, muy comodos para realizar cualquier actividad llegaron en el tiempo acordado y sin ninguna novedad los recomiendo ampliamente |||1
Purchased these for my 12 yr old daughter and she is in love with them.. wears them EVERY day. Shipping time was immediate! I cannot complain. |||1
Very nice looking shoe and very comfortable !! You can wear them all day and no problems.I bought them for my daughter and she loves them . |||1
always wear a size 11 in every shoe. these were too big but i wear an orthotic/insole so they were perfect. most definitely order a size down |||1
They fit great width wise but seem a little long, but I think that's just how Chuck's are. I wear size 7.5 in women's shoes and the 5.5 were a |||1
good fit for me. |||1
I really love shoes. I'm always looking for shoes. This pair cought my atention because of its color, a very nice and uniform green that goes perfectly ok with jeans |||1
or shorts. I use to wear them for my afternoon walks, to go to the beach and for any casual event like coffee with friends, the movies and so. I |||1
like these shoes a lot!! |||1
My 11 year old granddaughter asked for these for her birthday. I was happy to find these Converse shoes on Amazon and the price was less than any other site! |||1
She beamed when she opened them and couldn't wait to try them on! They were perfect! I was so pleased that she liked them and I got to be a |||1
big hit with my granddaughter! |||1
Great shoes good price arrived quickly great Job Love the shoes what else can I say Converse shoes like these are cool and durable Happy customer |||1
I enjoy them every time I wear them. Comfortable, sporty and hip enough so that my daughter's friends actually listen to me. |||1
DONT stop selling the low top of these chuck taylors. I keep finidng high top ones but finally found these low top ones and boy EVERBODY loves these shoes on |||1
my baby boy!! I must admit they look so much better on him than I even thought. I am so pleased Im gonna buy another pair in a different color. |||1
They really do look awesome on and as long as these shoes havebeen around they still top the cake with comparable cloth sneakers! |||1
This Product is highly recommended.Ordered my regular shoe size. Perfect fit.Color, Material and size exactly what I wanted. |||1
I love these shoes, so cute and I wear them every day! I wish I had them in every color. And they shipped so fast |||1
the shoes look good, they are confortable, and the price is not that high, these are the classic converse, they are good |||1
They fit better as expected, I'm a 12 EE and the 12 M fit fine. I ended up returning to get something else but they fit good (even if you |||1
have duck feet like me) and arrived as described. |||1
For a long long time I have wanted a pair of these in pink. I think years ago these were made only for males because my brothers had them. From |||1
time to time I have seen them but never in pink. Well finally pink and I jumped on them as soon as I saw them. I have worn them and |||1
got some really nice compliments. I am a "young" senior and I wore these with my crop jeans and with my long jeans folded up and they really look great! |||1
I am a fashionista! |||1
I keep buying this shoe because I know exactly what size I need and it's comfortable and Converse doesn't change it to something that doesn't work. |||1
I keep buying both the low profile and high top versions for my son as he grows, and he loves them. The shoe fits nice, has a good flexible sole |||1
for running on both pavement and grass, so for a toddler, that is a plus. Also, he can wear them all day, and is comfortable. I think the fabric is |||1
good for developing feet that need to stretch, but still give enough support. He likes these way better than the Saucony's I bought him, which seemed to never break in, |||1
and were a bear to put on. |||1
I bought these shoes specifically to wear while I am performing squat exercises when working out. Of course, I wear them for the whole workout, not just during the squat. |||1
I don't wear them any other time, they are strictly gym shoes for me.For working out they are excellent. They keep my feet flat and stable when I am straining |||1
to lower and raise the weight bar on my shoulders. They are comfortable and utilitarian during the other exercises.I would not wear them as everyday shoes - to me they |||1
are not *that* comfortable. I only wear them for about six hours a week, but they are good quality and still look brand new after many months. If they wear |||1
out before I do, I will certainly replace them with the same brand and style. |||1
I love my classic converse! The are very comfortable and I can wear them with pretty much anything! I love them! They are exactly what they described them to be! |||1
Very nice! |||1
Hey, it's Converse, what more needs to be said??? My son bought these for his girlfriend for Christmas as they were on her Amazon wish list. Let's hear it for |||1
"old school" chic!!! : ) |||1
Perfect bright color, love these Chucks! A perfect new look for a wonderful classic, goes with everything, but gets noticed, too! |||1
Getting these in white wasn't that easy, had to wait a couple of weeks for the price and size and color options to be right. But finally got them and |||1
my girlfriend was pretty happy! The fit just right. |||1
Always loved Converse, so this was perfect for my son. He also loves the bright color. The fit is perfect. |||1
daughter loves these shoes for school. fast shipment with no issues. will buy again from this seller. |||1
Purchased for my daughter. She loves the sneaker, runs slightly larger than normal shoe size. I would order 1/2 size smaller. |||1
As anyone who has ever own Chuck's knows, they are narrow. However, they stretch out after a while. My husband has wanted a pair for a few years now and |||1
this was the only place I could find his size. He has big old Flintstone feet. |||1
I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8. |||1
One of the very few places that sell these above a size 13 and a few dollars cheaper than buying directly from Converse.These are the real deal, in case there |||1
were any concerns! |||1
I bought these for my daughter who wore her previous Converse into the ground. She was a little hesitant about the gray color, but likes it now. She gave them |||1
4 stars because she wishes they had arch support. |||1
I've many many pairs of Chucks in my life and these were just what I expected. True to size, great color, and awesome quality. The shipping time was decent. |||1
These shoes hold up better than any of the imitation ones I have tried with a similar style, so they are all I was hoping for. Good quality and the |||1
style I like. |||1
My granddaughter put these on her 13th birthday gift list and I was fortunate to get the last pair in this size and color. (Evidently no other color would do.) |||1
Personally, I thought they looked a bit stiff and uncomfortable, but she seemed to find them just right. I loved them because she loved them. |||1
This is a great looking, simple looking sneaker or deck shoe in a variety of colors. I wear an 11 1/2 EW (EEE). These shoes were only offered in D |||1
widths, so I bought 12D. It fits my foot length and width, but it's a little tight from the top of my foot to the sole of my foot. I |||1
wear a 1/2" lift in my left shoe, but it won't fit in this shoe. I wear this sneaker without my lift if I'm driving with only short walks outside |||1
the car. The soles don't afford much protection if I step on a walnut in my back yard - so I try not to do that. I bought these shoes |||1
in green and red. The first time I wore them, a young man passed me and said, "Great Chucks." |||1
these chucks in the charcoal color are darker in person than in the picture. they are true to size for my husband and they are a great neutral color. |||1
When buying Converse brand shoes be sure to buy them a size smaller than what you would normally wear with most other brands. Converse uses a different measuring system than |||1
other major brands (which makes no sense to me), which is why you should order about a size smaller for males or females. I ordered a female size 7.5 for |||1
someone who normally wears a 8.5 in women, and it fit well. Hope this helps! |||1
I've always loved Converse shoes as they are trendy and comfy. I absolutely love the shoes, though the color I chose (Parasailing) it's a little bit different from the one |||1
shown in the picture, a little more towards green than turquoise. Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase. The seller is concerned about getting feedback from the customer on their |||1
overall purchase experience., which I think it's great. |||1
Absolutely Love them. Quick shipment, perfect fit, color and comfort! Love them. Cant say anything negative about them. Hope everyone else enjoys |||1
I wanted a pair of low-cut Cons All-Stars for just hanging out, and as a reminder of the ones I wore as a kid. But for sure I didn't want |||1
to spend a hundred bucks! These are great. Fit is good, quality good, and they came with an extra pair of shoelaces! No arch support at all, but you need |||1
to know that before you buy, so you won't be disappointed. I put in a pair of my Dr. Schols inserts and I'm a happy camper, lol. Have been wearing |||1
them constantly since they arrived. |||1
These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color. My only complaint about converse is that they are a |||1
bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them. I am happy about |||1
the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon). They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain. |||1
I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb. I've been through many pairs, and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a |||1
blown out heel I wanted to go with something new. The white is really an eye catching color, and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there. |||1
BE WARNED, Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size. For example I wear a size 7 in women's, which would be a size 5 in Chucks, |||1
but these are really too big so I went with the size 4. I find the white adds some contrast, especially if you wear dark colors like I do. |||1
If you didn't already know, make sure you order 1/2 a size smaller then you normally would when ordering Converse.Love these shoes. |||1
These are green converse and they are awesome. I am a converse whore. My closet is filled with all the different colors. I can't stop myself! |||1
I've bought these for work, where I stand for an average of 8 hrs at a time.Comfortable, great traction, inexpensive. |||1
I purchased these classic converse to replace the old ones my boyfriend had. They fit true to size and are very comfortable! |||1
I love these shoes!!! I am a size 81/2 normally in girls and most shoes look horrible with my skinny jeans. These shoes make my feet look petit and go |||1
perfect with my skinny jeans. |||1
My son has these in every color. It's difficult to say anything else but that he loves converse shoes. Happy to have purchased. |||1
Unlike what other reviewers said, this shoe is EXACTLY the correct size. I will say, though, the tag on the inside of the shoe has weird sizing information. for instance, |||1
it says that my size 11.5 men's shoes (US) are size 9.5 Mens (US)... I ordered 11.5's and these are, in fact, 11.5... I have no idea why the sizing |||1
info on the tag is wrong as these do not appear to be counterfeit shoes. |||1
I bought them as a present for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier. The color is vibrant and full of life! Also, converse are great shoes. |||1
Do these shoes always run so big? I had to sell them to a friend who has a much bigger foot than I. |||1
The shoe is as expected, although a little more mushroom colored than the gray I was expecting, and there was no extra pair of black laces even if it clearly |||1
stated that there would be. So, the price was good and the shoe fits, but the lack of the "extras" lost it one star in my estimation. |||1
I have been looking for a great pair of Converse to wear with skirts and dresses. It has taken a while to find the right color, but I love this |||1
dark green. It is unique but subtle and very versatile. Obviously, the structure of these shoes is well known, the sole is thick and strong with good tread, and it |||1
laces up high. My one issue is they ran a little big. I usually wear a 9 1/2, but I knew I wanted to wear them without socks, so I |||1
bought a 9. Even the half-size down, they are a little big. Still, a great shoe and fabulous color! |||1
I thought I'd never be able to wear chucks because I'm a half size, and they only seem to sell whole sizes at the stores. I finally realized I could |||1
just buy them online! The shoes took about a week to wear in, but now they fit my feet perfectly. |||1
I have 10 pairs of Chucks, and I will keep replacing the ones that get so worn out, as these did. Can't go wrong with the classics! |||1
Great shoes! Reliving my younger days is great in these authentic Chuck Taylors! Retro never looked so good! Love them! |||1
Chuck Taylors are about as classic a pair of sneakers you can buy. These pink ones have a great bubblegum color and are perfect for the lady in your life |||1
who wants to rock pink kicks and look cool. |||1
This are my favorite shoes. For some reason they make me feel slightly quirky. I wear them whenever I need a little positive mental boost (like taking a mid-term!). |||1
These are the standard Chuck Taylors so not a ton to say but...* These are MUCH brighter than the picture, at least in pink. It's refreshing but also a bit |||1
intimidating.* I said in another review for a different color that buyers should go half a size lower than normal. I repeat that here in this case. |||1
This is my second pair of chucks so I kind of knew what to expect. I also have a pair of high tops and love them but decided to get |||1
a low top for the summer. I got them in carmine rose and they are such a pretty color, so glad I went with them! It is a light and |||1
airy shoe for spring and summer and the color isn't too girly or childish, I just love it. They will look cute with anything from shorts to skirts to jeans. |||1
Converse is a go to classic. But, if you need arch or ankle support these are not for you. |||1
First pair of converses and look really good. I went with red cause its cheap but they look great!! word |||1
a little overpriced for the quality. not nearly the quality of Chuck Taylor Converse from the past, undoubtedly from being made in Indonesia. |||1
These are a vibrant pink and I get lots of compliments! As usual, Converse run a half size too large and no support. |||1
I love converse SO much. i wore my old ones until they had holes in them and were falling apart. i just got these and of course I LOVE THEM. |||1
they are 100% REAL AUTHENTIC converse. the shipping was extremely fast, and very safely packaged :) thank you so much |||1
I love these. So cute and just right |||1
I love them in every color!! :) The shoes are simple and perfect! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so! I highly recommend |||1
these! |||1
These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform. |||1
Its not that white as expected but it was fine, it was what i expected only the white was kinda like a beige. |||1
Product itself was great, but the size wasn't marked well, so I ordered a 2 toddler. My daughter is 8 years old so I needed a 2 youth. Watch the |||1
size you order! |||1
Fits well, looks good. Great work apparel for working in a game studio A little narrower than I'm used to. Fit is nicer though. |||1
call me crazy, call me weird, call me what you want. A girl in chuck taylors is a girl in my heart. high heels schmigh heels. chucks are where its |||1
at. The low key throw em on and classic style you see everyone wear. The first of many for my girlfriend, she will have about 13 different colors ^__^ |||1
I had been wanting another pair of the unbleached Converse Chuck Taylor's for years. I am so glad that they fit the same as they did years ago. My feet |||1
are a little wide. So I order the unisex size and not the women's shoes, as I find the women's fit snugger. These are made well and I'm completely satisfied. |||1
I love my chucks they fit perfect. It was exactly what I expected and at a great price. I would definitely recommend it to everyone that falls between sizes cuz |||1
the stores usually only Carrie the full sizes. Half sizes make a difference. |||1
I bought these for my 13 yr old son. They cost about the same price at the mall but it's always a plus when you can avoid going to the |||1
mall. Chuck's run larger so you have to get a size smaller than what you would normally wear. I found that out when I had to do a return and |||1
reorder. Other than that, he seems to like his Chuck's. I've bought a few more in different colors because he likes them so much. |||1
My... 10th pair of cons in 10 years. If you have never owned a pair of Cons, they will last about a year of regular use. They are not good |||1
in bad weather. They do not have any arch support or cushioning on the sole. They are not waterproof. They have poor traction. That being said, I love them just |||1
the way they are. |||1
I have never been so lifted dependably in all my life, probably since a teen. I can run, work, do anything and they stay in place. |||1
I ride horses and some of them are a little on the rough side when it comes to trotting. I feel totally secure with this item holding in the 'girls.' |||1
There is a little bit of bounce, but I guess if there wasn't any, I'd be a boy. ha haDefinitely want to order a size larger than what you'd usually |||1
wear. It can run a little on the tight side. After washing, it feels tight, but then after a day, it stretches out enough to be comfortable.It does take a |||1
few wears to get used to it and to "mold" it to your body. It can be quite uncomfortable at first...feel like a straight jacket....but only at first, then it's |||1
great. You don't notice you've got it on.I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a good hold. I'm not crazy about the pink color, but what the heck, it's not |||1
lingerie! |||1
What a releif this bra is for me. I can run, jump rope, and perform other aerobic athletic activities without a hint of a jiggle! This is a muist have |||1
for the active well-endowed! |||1
I love this bra, fits tight and holds the girls in but i will say right after i got it one of the snaps broke off i think it was |||1
defective so now i have a bra i paid alot for that one hook can't be snapped but other then that i love it, i have went thru alot of |||1
bra's and this is by far the best support it is kinda hot and takes a little getting used to it is my first compresion bra, so that may be |||1
it for me, but i would say if you are larger busted try it, i just wish my bra would not have broke it would have got 5 stars if |||1
it had not broke. i was very disapointed in that but like i said not one of the other snaps have broke so i really think it was a defect |||1
of some kind. |||1
This is the only sports bra that I have ever worn that can also be used as a minimizer as well. It worked very good at flattening my big chest |||1
making it impossible for the big huge sacks I call breast to even budge one centimeter.The downfalls of this bra is that it is hard to put on the first |||1
time and really does not break in and feel comfortable and natural until you have worn the thing many times. Also it took time to put the bra on as |||1
it has over 10 hooks to fasten painstakingly one at a time.However, the positive is that I had this same model bra for over 2 years and has survived constant |||1
wear, tear, and abuse.To sum up this review it is worth the money if you are up to enduring some discomfort until the bra breaks in and is looking for |||1
an excellent minimizer.AS for an actual sports bra for activities where you will be doing alot of moving and flexing of the upper body I do not recommend this bra. |||1
You might want to try the Moving Comfort line as they have excellent support for big chests. |||1
This is definately a great bra, well made but it runs alittle small, imo. It has a great support built in and I'm sure it would last a long time |||1
as the quality is great. I will try for another size! |||1
This is a great product! It offers the best support for me when I go for a jog or just working out at the gym. It holds you in place |||1
and you don't have to worry about any bounce. You'll feel super supported and won't want to use another bra after trying this one out! |||1
It was easy to follow the sizing guide and the bra I received fit appropriately (it's supposed to be tight!). I like fastening it in the front instead of the |||1
back, but there are quite a few hooks that can be tedious to fix up each time. I was disappointed in the efficacy of the bra for vigorous activity. This |||1
was my last stop in my tour of expensive sports bras that the interwebs say are best for ladies with large breasts, and I was hoping that it would blow |||1
the competition out of the water. It didn't. It's playing nicely with the other bras in the water. This bra works fine, but I didn't find it to be anything |||1
special. |||1
If you are a busty woman (anywhere from C cup or above), then this bra is for you. I have tried numerous other (very expensive) sports bras, but none has |||1
provided the level of support AND comfort that the Enell does. Now, I have no problem with the fact that there are no strap adjustments, but apparently some women find |||1
the straps are too short/long for them. It fits me perfectly and I have changed sizes over the years. Be sure to take the time to measure your rib cage |||1
(below the breast) and across your breasts to determine the correct size to order. The basic calculation is breast size (let's say a 40) minus rib cage size (say 34) |||1
equals your cup size (40-34 = 6). Count the alphabet to 6 letters (in our example, F) and that's your cup size. Many products use double and triple D, so |||1
an F = DDD as well. As anyone with large breasts knows, it can be difficult to get excited about exercise when every bounce hurts, but exercise is SO important |||1
for our physical and mental health. So take a little time to figure out your size, and spend a little extra money, and get a good bra! |||1
This may be a good sports bra but it is for smaller cup sizes with larger band sizes. A lot of hooks to fasten. |||1
I'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest. I am forever on a search for the perfect bra. For sports, this is it. I can wear it in my |||1
highest impact activities, and everything stays put. It's not really attractive, and sure doesn't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top, but it does the job. Getting into |||1
it is a little tricky; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up, adjusting your breasts as you go. It is supposed to feel tight, so you |||1
might think you have the wrong size at first. But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable. ZERO bounce or movement. Incredible! |||1
I usually wear a regular bra plus two to three sports bras. Now I can wear just one. It is amazing! |||1
38DD. You MUST use the Enell specific sizing chart--as far as I can tell it's not on the Ammy link, so use the website for your measurements!It's Ugly, it squishes, |||1
and the fit feels weird at first and did I mention ugly?It's also long lasting, and does what it's supposed to. Keeps the girls still so I can go running. |||1
I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I'm done it would get a little uncomfortable. However, I've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done |||1
sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory (and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO...and in fact would not even |||1
ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me--my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that...so don't try and buy this as a |||1
gift if you are going through Enell...obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon...but I digress).Despite my unhappiness with Enell, I do love the product and I'm |||1
vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again. Particularly as I start making plans to do another sprint triathlon, this style works very well |||1
under my suit.Extremely Highly Recommended for larger busted people who are doing something high impact like running.JTG |||1
I love this bra. I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is |||1
a lot of postential for jiggling to outright flopping. In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement. It is a compreesion bra, so you |||1
are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing. And when I am working out hard I'm |||1
a make-upless, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into |||1
it, so I figured I wuld tell you the easiest way:1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.2. Leave your boobs |||1
where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the |||1
bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit |||1
height.4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra |||1
and scoop up your left boob and pull it ino the bra. Do the same with your left hand, right boob.6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing |||1
the same direction, then easiely hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.Ta-Da!I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C |||1
or smaller this may not be the bra for you. If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not |||1
need a bra this sturdy. For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking. However, if you are an older lady who |||1
maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well |||1
endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of |||1
gravity for as long as possible. |||1
I have tried several types of sports bras, but always come back to the Enell. Have to admit, they aren't the most attractive but you will not find a better |||1
supporting sports bra. I wear a D cup in a regular bra. I can run wearing the Enell with no bounce and it makes my run so much more comfortable. |||1
I would tell every women to at least try it. In support and comfort, you will not be disappointed. |||1
This bra is great for running... The girls stay in place! It's a different feel with this sports bra than with others, but once you get used to it, this |||1
bra is perfect for high impact activities. |||1
I wanted a bra that kept everything in place whether walking, jumping jacks or running. This bra has kept up with the pace. There are alot of eye hooks, but |||1
it works. I would buy another one again if I needed it. I would recommend this bra to anyone. |||1
Okay, I normally wear a 40 band bra, and an F/G cup depending on the brand. In a Lane Bryant Full Coverage bras I wear a 40DDD. I followed the |||1
measurements and this bra holds very well, but I have spillage at the sides and the top. The band fit correctly and I honestly feel if I went up a |||1
size the band would be too big. For myself I will seek a bra with cups and not numbers. This bra is awesome if you are a 40 DD, (40 |||1
DDD the biggest) as the sizing chart states. I give credit to the fact that for the cup sizes provided was correct. I guess my "girls" are just way too |||1
big. I will keep it and wear a compression vest on top of it. My measurements did fit a size 4 though, so for ladies looking for some serious hold, |||1
definitely get this. |||1
This bra is very durable and I love the thick straps that do not cut into my shoulders - LOVE IT! However, the measurement method and sizes will not always |||1
be correct, as the recommended way to measure may be correct but the sizes recommended are not.I did the measurements as instructed and was given a size to buy and |||1
the cups are way too small - my breasts are spilling out on the sides. Some may be wanting to say go a size bigger but if I do, the |||1
bra will be too slack, as it is the bra is very comfortable but the cups are way off. I need a bra just like this but with bigger cups. |||1
Any recommendations? |||1
I closely studied the strange sizing chart for this bra, and ordered a size 3 a few months ago. This turned out to be too big, so I ordered a |||1
size 2. The size 2 was way too small! I am about a 38F; the 3 had too much room while the 2 didn't even fit around me. This gap |||1
in sizing has me confused but maybe when I lose some weight I will decide to try this bra again. |||1
If you like breasts that are cube-shaped, this is the one for you! As much as I loved the back of this bra, I positively gasped at how it made |||1
my chest look. It got rid of any roundness, and just flattened the front...not a flattering look. Returning tomorrow...and the search continues. |||1
I bought a white Enell about 3 years ago and had it fitted in a store. So that was helpful because I was confident in what size I needed to |||1
buy. But the size chart provided is helpful and seems to be accurate for me. This is SO supportive and makes my workouts so much better. Also this is the |||1
only bra I can run in. I will say the purple one feels slightly cheaper than the white one I bought years ago. The straps are a little papery/less padded. |||1
I'm not sure if that is because it's newer and they have changed them all or just this purple one is different. But either way it's still great and very |||1
supportive! Will probably order one more in black just so I have a clean one at all times. |||1
With a 32FF bust playing squash and doing karate can be trying. This bra is like an armour but it allows you to breath and move. NOTHING jiggles!!! You will |||1
never buy another sports bra. |||1
After putting it on i cant breathe, I bought right size but its still smug. holds great though. Im gonna try a size up, if it werent so expensive |||1
I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3. (42 bust and 37 rib cage) The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage, but |||1
I thought I'd need a 2 to really compress everything. I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib |||1
cage. As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top |||1
part, but it works! There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me. In fact, I |||1
hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what |||1
the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem. It's really hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make |||1
you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra. But I think it looks fine. It |||1
just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support. Turbo Kick and |||1
the elliptical trainer aren't places to have fashion shows, anyway, though, so I'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper, OneSweetOne, was also fast. I ordered on a Wednesday, got it on a Tuesday--one |||1
day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012. I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great! We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing, and |||1
I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS. I think there's still a shifting movement in the bra, but I honestly don't notice it since it's |||1
not impeding my workout. I feel like I have better balance and control as I move. |||1
I have 40/38 DD size breasts but I love to run. :-( THis bra has been my go to bra when running, doing HIIT and Turbo Fire. I've tried other |||1
bras such as the Panache and to double bra other bras but nothing compares. My ONLY gripe is that it's not adjustable and at 64 bucks a bra that sucks |||1
especially if you're losing weight because you'll have to spend more money on a smaller bra. Get this bra if you're looking for maximum support. I'm actually going to buy |||1
another one because I don't want to have only one. |||1
This bra does what it claims it will do--it provides firm support even for plus sized women, and the support doesn't go away after washing. I just wish it weren't |||1
so shiny. It's not terribly attractive, just functional, but the straps will show with most clothing, so you may want a lacy camisole over this. Unless they can change the |||1
shininess without reducing the support, I'll live with it 'as is'. A great bra in terms of function! |||1
I bought the size that fits 34DD and I feel so constricted in this thing! It's not comfortable to run in for me. I feel like I can't draw enough |||1
breath. However, it does hold my top in place, so I don't move at all. |||1
again, i bought this based on a recommendation of a friend, i absolutely hated the fabric it was a cheezy almost las vegas type shiny fabric, ugh also the straps |||1
were too short. i couldnt fit it right. did not like the front closure either,, you need a whole day just to get the thing on!dumb design in my eyes, |||1
i sent it back, |||1
Pros: no bounce, very supportive, holds everything in & even does some minimizing.The big con is their goofy sizing. I ordered according to the measuring system the company uses, which |||1
put me right in the middle of the #2 range. It turned out to be too small in the cups, especially. I experienced the same ass everyone else in that |||1
the band is waaaaay tight! It gave me head & neck aches wearing it the first few times, though I did not mind the extra back support. I read that |||1
this bra is supposed to be extra tight so I just accepted that. But I can't accept boob spillage out the sides & squishing them together in the middle. I |||1
love this bra, I love the idea behind what it's supposed to do. I guess I just need to do some re-sizing, maybe up one or two sizes & see |||1
how that goes. I really want to love this bra! |||1
I bought this as a valentine's day present for my partner, and we're both quite impressed with it. The seams are tough, the fabric is wonderful, and the function is |||1
supurb... it keeps her breasts largely immobile even during the most vigorous exercise, and keeps her looking fabulous while she's doing it! |||1
I bought this bra not with sports in mind. This is not a 'pretty, feminine' bra. As a large busted woman, I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting |||1
bras. I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage. This bra provides both--however the drawbacks are: 1)the straps are not long enough for me and 2) It gives you that |||1
'minimizer bra' look. Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage. You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops. |||1
I've always had a pretty full bust. I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches...only to have her comment |||1
that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce. She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on. Since a pretty dramatic |||1
weight gain, the bounce has gotten worse. When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes, I couldn't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious...plus jumping around without good |||1
support is very uncomfortable. So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog (with rave reviews), I went ahead and splurged. I have to say |||1
that I'm very pleased. The bra compresses but it also provides a lot of lift from below. I feel supported AND lifted instead of just getting squash-chest like the other |||1
bras out there. And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle. |||1
Also, because of the unique satin-like material (versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras), my shirts don't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still, I couldn't quite give it |||1
a perfect 5-star rating. For one thing, I'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob. The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small, but I |||1
don't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around...speaking of which, it is a bit of an non-traditional fit. The shoulder straps are pretty |||1
short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back...really high. Also, the price makes this a luxury item. I don't know if I will ever own more |||1
than one at a time, especially if my weight loss is successful and I go down a size or so. I just hope this bra holds up well with frequent |||1
washing. |||1
If you are blessed/cursed with large breasts you need this bra. I have never had another bra that actually holds you in place comfortably while you exercise without choking you. |||1
It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I would recommend this to any woman who never thought they would be able to do a jumping jack without hurting |||1
themselves or others! Terrific fit, great bra. |||1
I heard great things about this bra. I am a size 36 E (DDDD) and got the size 3. This should fit based on the measurements provided in the sizing |||1
guide. It is hard to get on, so I know I couldn't get a bigger size, but my boobs bounce around like crazy and hurt. I expected to have a |||1
lot more support |||1
I love running, and I hate when flat or small chested woman tell me to get a breast reduction surgery. I wish I could slap them in the face. its |||1
not my fault I have big boobs or that guys prefer my boobs over theirs. I love this bra, it is the best; most supportive bra I have ever had. |||1
I can finally run without pain or discomfort. |||1
This bra is so secure and hides some stuff too in the back. The bands on the shoulders are wide and don't hurt. I love this bra so much that |||1
I purchased more of them and wear them as a regular bra. The only thing is sometimes I have to come out of them because of blouses with low cleavage |||1
or open shoulders. |||1
i can't wait to try it on. it is so hard to find comfortable bra's that fit big busted women. i like the fact the hooks are in the front. |||1
order came fast! |||1
As a bigger lady its hard to find sports bras that fit and work. This one is great. I would suggest looking on enell's website to get your size. |||1
keeps the ta tas in place! go to there website for sizing info. although front clasps are a bit tricky, i feel like i am in some kind of super |||1
hero bra suit armor type thing and feel excellent support at the gym. |||1
I just received this bra and I rate it 4 stars just because it is tight, as mentioned in the other reviews. Otherwise, it looks good, and it seems to |||1
perform well. I like the fact that it closes in the front. I will keep it and I hope it will loosen up in time. |||1
I have used a version of this bag for many years and keep coming back to it. I tried a Baggallini bag recently and decided I didn't like it so |||1
well because it actually had too many compartments for me and I'd forget where I put things. With the Ameribag, I find things more easily. I also need to carry |||1
a water bottle with me and this bag has just the right amount of space for it, whereas I didn't have that with my Baggallini. I have lengthened the strap |||1
to use it cross-body style, which is more comfortable for me to carry. The extra-small version is just right for me, a short person. The larger ones are a little |||1
too big. With this size, I can fit a baglet inside, which can be handy at times. I like that this nylon bag is washable. It cleans up easily! |||1
First one arrived with the little plastic hook that connects the bottom strap broken. Not sure I like this way of connecting strap seems cheap where metal may be better |||1
way, as women even this size is smaller than previous ones owned by LL Bean. Wanted to have smaller bag hoping to lighten my load, so to speak as my |||1
shoulder is paying the price now older. Nice pockets with magnets on outside and set up the same with many pockets. I will use the second one sent to replace |||1
first but, will most likely go back to LL Beans. The only thing on that one after years of use the zipper stopped working. |||1
Great bag and I love the nylon material. The color in person is richer in red than in the picture. |||1
This bag holds a lot of stuff in easy-to-access pockets. The wide shoulder strap is very comfortable and has a no-slip backing that keeps it in place. The overall design |||1
of the bag does seem to cause less stress on my shoulder and back. I will buy another one in a different color. |||1
I don't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in. I do not like their bag. |||1
Ordered this, my umpteenth Healthy Back Bag, as a tiny accessory to hold my stuff when we go out to dinner. It's the perfect size, unobtrusive, tastefully black, works with |||1
anything I wear. Neither too little, and definitely not big. Holds my Blackberry, a notepad, pen, my sunglasses/change of glasses, and a sundry thing or 2.Love it. |||1
I got the desert color - a fantastic, go-with-everything khaki color. This is a very casual bag, so if you dress up every day, it might not be for you. |||1
I love that it has a place for everything and I'm hoping to pick up a larger sized Ameribag for traveling. Now they just need to make a Back Bag |||1
for lap tops!added 1/11/2012: I just came back to buy my 3rd Ameribag, the brown one this time - it's a beautiful, rich, cognac color. Love it! Also a note |||1
on Ameribag's customer service and warranty - a strap that holds a d-ring on the inside of one of my other bags ripped. I gave them a call and they're |||1
having me return the bag for fixing or a replacement. Very easy to deal with and very nice people. |||1
This is a review of the Crimson color distressed nylon bag, extra small.I have major back problems and chronic pain, and went on a search for a lighter everyday bag. |||1
This is perfect. I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it won't be suitable. I have a smaller clutch that I use for |||1
occasions that call for more formal attire.While not one of those women who carries around everything but the kitchen sink, I am still amazed at how much I can fit |||1
into this bag. Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here, with room to spare. What's more, this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse, which is precisely |||1
what I needI agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small. However, it does a great job of holding my sunglasses, which is more useful to |||1
me for daily use.The only negative is the small, narrow size of the two outer pockets. I love the magnetic closures, but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small |||1
for my iPhone with Otterbox case. Instead, I use it for my little pill container. I haven't put anything in the smaller side pocket; seems to small for most things.Other |||1
reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag, no matter what the advertisement says. It's the newer HBB-evo bag. That doesn't bother me, but it may |||1
bother someone else, so I think it's worth mentioning. If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag, it shows only one flap pocket on the side. There |||1
are actually two.I guess I'm so impressed with the overall weight and function of this bag that the outer flap pocket design is really not a big deal. For an |||1
organized person like me who strongly believes there should be a place for everything and that everything should be in its place, this is almost perfect. |||1
This bag is perfect for the new 10" netbooks. I have an Asus 1000he and have been having trouble finding a lightweight and attractive bag for it. The larger battery |||1
(9.5 hrs) makes it just a touch too big for most 10" bags and sleeves out there.I can fit my netbook in its neoprene sleeve in the main section, portable |||1
DVD drive, portable HD, power brick and cords for them all. The outside pocket holds my wallet, Ipod, Iphone, pens and a small pad of paper. My plane ticket goes |||1
in the back zippered pocket. There are NO MAGNETS anywhere on this bag.The best part is when I want to travel light, I can take out the rest of the |||1
netbook accessories and the bag slims right down. Or I can use this as a lightweight crossbody bag that just happens to have my netbook in it. There is plenty |||1
of room for that and purse things.The vertical profile makes it easy to get the netbook in and out and redistributes the weight more ergonomically. Fully loaded, it feels much |||1
lighter than a similar horizontal bag. I love that this bag is lightweight to begin with, unlike specialized laptop bags that weigh more than the laptop itself empty!It is not |||1
meant to be a laptop bag, but the extra space in the bag enables you to add more padding and protection if you want to and still end up lighter |||1
when fully packed than an empty off-the-shelf Staples netbook bag. You'd be a lot more stylish too.The black, navy and slate colors are guy friendly and look like a cool |||1
and compact crossbody bag. The shoulder strap extends to comfortably fit a medium-build guy. The main compartment measures 2"depth & the front compartment is an extra 3/4". |||1
Bag is more of a Christmas Red to me - which I LOVE. Many compartments as I like and this holds twice as much as other brand bags while weighing |||1
less. Fits my iPad without a problem (in slim case). The design makes this bag not too bulky for me. |||1
I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon. I plan to use it for long day trips, weekend trips, and vacations. It has plenty of room, |||1
separate sections, and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff! I can't wait to use it! I have smaller bags like this where the strap |||1
goes across the body, and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long, but I definitely needed a bigger one (but not too big - haha). I |||1
feel safer knowing it can't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear. It is made well and I like that the material will repel water. |||1
Great bag! |||1
I own multiples in this style Kipling. While I think it is plain for me for everyday, it makes a fabulous travel or day trip bag, especially if you have |||1
children. The bag is lightweight with tons of organization. The strap is comfortable and doesn't rub and burn your skin. it's a durable but soft, unlike some other nylon strap |||1
bags I own (and need to get rid of because they don't compare!) |||1
I've totally embraced the cross body bag style and I was looking for a brown bag for Fall after enjoying my Keen Brooklyn II Hemp bag all summer and loving |||1
all the organization that that one offered. This is almost identical in style so it was easy to transition all of my items into this secure bag and still have |||1
them relatively in the same spots. As a bonus - this bag is lighter! It even appears to be water resistant, although I don't plan to test that theory. It |||1
holds my wallet, make up bag, small umbrella, two pairs of glasses, ear buds, cell phone, Kindle, and various little items in the interior small zip sections like keys, gum, |||1
kleenex, etc. I even squeezed a lunch bag on top and was still able to zip it shut thanks to the adjustable flap snap. This will be a great bag |||1
for travel as well but for day to day commuting into the city with slots for everything and everything secured with zippers, it's great. And although it lists for $78 |||1
on numerous websites, I found it on Amazon for $55. Sweet! Thanks, Amazon! Oh and the monkey is cute too. |||1
the ring is pretty but just a little to flashy for me the band is not made for small hands |||1
I ordered this ring because I needed something gold on my right hand to go with another ring. It's very pretty, just a bit too yellow. I still like it |||1
and will wear it when I need to balance out the gold. |||1
i really like this ring, great for everyday or dressing up. it is a little thick but the gold looks very real in person. i already got one compliment on |||1
it. |||1
Fits, is wearing well...looks good. Only things I would say is the gold is a little too bright/shiny for me. |||1
Very pretty. Looks like the real thing. No one has ever asked if its real, they just assume it is and that it's worth a lot! |||1
I wish I read the actual reviews when I put it on my wish list. Come to find out, you need to ORDER IT IN A LARGE SIZE!Once I purchased |||1
a larger size, it is beautiful! Excellent quality and matches well with my wedding rings. |||1
Buxton doesn't seem to have the quality that it used to. I do like the organizational aspect of it and the room for a cell phone. The edging where the |||1
credit cards slide in is unfinished and I don't think it will wear well. |||1
This is a very useful bag and is as described. The only caveat is the leather - it's rather stiff and not very good quality. That said, it's a bargain |||1
for the price. |||1
I LOVE this bag/bilfold! It fits in my compact little purse...but doubles as a purse in itself. What could be more perfect? |||1
I was looking for a bag that was small enough that I wouldn't have to carry on my shoulder or would be too heavy (I have a medical condition). This |||1
bag had enough space for all my important credit cards, and a handy one for my driver's license and a mirror next to it. It has a change compartment in |||1
the back, also a compartment for bills and another zippered compartment on the inside. On top of that, there is space to fit my cell phone, lipstick, nail file, and |||1
it could accommodate a couple more items (small though). It has a small hand strap that pulls out from inside the bag and a long strap if you wanted to |||1
use it as a shoulder bag which can easily be taken off. The leather is quite soft and the bag itself looks quite classy. The only complaint I would have |||1
is that the snap that closes the bag can be hard to close, but it is very secure. i would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a small bag |||1
that accommodates all your important stuff. |||1
I really like the nude color of this clutch as I can use it with different outfits and colors.The size is perfect for my cell, lipstick, cards and ID. Lots |||1
of space in a small bag. |||1
I bought this purse as a backup because I like the pockets and various compartments and don't like to carry a large purse around with me. I also like that |||1
it has a strap that I can put around me and there I go out shopping without worrying about where my purse is |||1
This is the fifth Buxton of this style I've owned. They are a grab and go item when running errands/shopping. Because I tote my own canvas and insulated shopping bags |||1
to the farmers' market and grocery stores, I no longer carry a hand bag/purse. The Buxton clutch is tossed into the shopping bag.As to layout, credit card slots are in |||1
perfect location, easy to see and access. I use the checkbook holder for folding money (the little that I carry). There's a zipper compartment for plenty of coin, spare key |||1
fob is attached inside, mirror is attached on flap, and there's room for cell phone, lipstick, kleenex, what have you.I have tried other higher end wallets which look good but |||1
can't touch the organizational ability of this clutch. I use it without the easily removable strap.I would be hard pressed to find the quality and convenience at this price anywhere |||1
else. I've owned black, beige, brown, navy, and red, and they are all equally attractive (don't look cheesy). |||1
Great size, can wear under your coat without bulge. Design deserves five star. Made from cheap plastic/vinyl material. Improvement on man made material could be done. |||1
I had just about given up all hope of finding a replacement for the wallet I have had for more than 15 years. This one is almost identical to my |||1
old one; only the color is different. It is sleek, functional, well built and even arrived earlier than anticipated. |||1
My wallet appears to be a taupe color. The colors I would have preferred were out of stock. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with the color I got. |||1
It isn't fully leather so don't yet know how long it will last. It comes with a check book cover which can be removed. Haven't any cash, so can't tell |||1
how happy it would be in the compartments, but my credit card and insurance etc cards seem perfectly happy :). I especially like that the ID view pocket has a |||1
hole in the center which makes it much easier to get you DL out when needed. |||1
I have had my wallet,card/ck book holder/attached coin purse for about 7 years. It is perfect for me. When my Mom saw it she loved it so of course I |||1
bought her one as a gift and she loved it. Then about 3 yrs ago her wallet was lost/stolen and she bought herself a different wallet that she didn't really |||1
like. Anyway, we all Prayed her wallet would be returned and 8 months later somebody put in in her mailbox!!!! Of course the $ was gone but her personal things |||1
were in tack.. Today she said she was looking for a new wallet because hers was a little shabby looking (mine is fine because I do 90% of my shopping |||1
"on-line" with Amazon. (no wear and tear shopping on line) My Mom said she looked in a few stores and wanted a wallet w/ the change purse attached and hasn't |||1
found one yet. Well of course I went on Amazon typed in buxton wallets and in 30 seconds I found our wallet. I called my Mom and just asked what |||1
color she wanted.. She said black would be just fine again.. I have just started my Christmas shopping!! Since my Mom doesn't ask for anything it's hard to buy something |||1
I know she would like AND use. So, thank you for still having this wallet on the market. I am going to fill up the credit card slots w/ store |||1
gift cards for Her. So a $21.00 plus gift turns into a $220.00 when it's opened. I also ordered the key chain/store scan card holder for her. (Mom doesn't keep |||1
her scan cards on her key chain so I think she might like it--I ordered it in red so its easy to find) I may just order myself another wallet |||1
just to save in case its discontinued... Great organizer/wallet... |||1
Great item!!! Would recommend to anyone who wants a great wallet, perfect size and color for the money. Would purchase again |||1
The Buxton Clutch carries the needed items a person must have when entering the world outside the home! Yep, it carries them all and is easy to carry itself. For |||1
me, there is plenty of room for credit cards, ATM cards, a special place for your driver's license, etc., plus paper money and even a coin purse.What more could you |||1
ask for? |||1
I needed a new one and say this and bought on a wim, But love it, I will buy a new just loke it when it&if ever falls apart! |||1
Good quality, handy and functional, no bells and whistles just a leather product that works. I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open |||1
up the whole thing. I don't like the zipper coin compartments because they don't open wide enough so this is just right. And the style and color is nice/classy. It |||1
also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots. The place designated for your driver's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to |||1
help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy. It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but don't |||1
use as much. Very nice. |||1
I had to replace my Buxton organizer clutch that I have had for years and years and years. Poor thing was definitely looking dog-eared. I was delighted when I received |||1
the new one, and found it was exactly like my old one. No cheapening of the product at all.This is not the fanciest purse organizer that you can buy, nor |||1
the most expensive. But if you want something that just gets the job done, than this is it. I expect that this will last for years also.Definitely recommended. |||1
This wallet has already been part of my handbag assembly for a week or so and I coudln't be happier with it-nice construction, design color, texture, and functions great. I'm |||1
very satisfied. |||1
I've only used the Buxton Convertible Billfold (my last one for over 7 years) as a wallet! I love the leather and color choices that are available. You get a |||1
great coin pocket with snap closure, insert for your license with removable plastic card pockets with another snap closure, plus your bill compartment. It's a great wallet for a wonderful |||1
price!! |||1
However for me it just doesn't hold enough to be really a piece I'd be able to carry long term. Now we all need so many club cards for stores |||1
you to those plus a credit card and drivers license you can barely squish your Health and Car insurance cards it it. Unless you don't have much to carry, I'd |||1
say skip it. Buxton, consider making this a little bigger to carry more and its a serious winner. Now if the banks would still make this style of checkbook It |||1
would be very convenient. |||1
My favorite style, by my favorite company! Buxton really makes nice items that stand the test of time. I was so happy to see all the colors and styles available. |||1
I would not hesitate to purchase item again. |||1
I think this is a very fashionable wallet. It really does wonders when you want to keep your money in something stylish. I haven't been this impressed with a wallet |||1
since theAlicia Klein Wallet "Park Avenue". This really is a fantastic wallet to have. I highly recommend getting it. |||1
It's not what I expected and it is to small. I will be giving them as gifts instead. Thank you! |||1
This is a very nice wallet. I purchased this one to replace the exact same wallet. My old wallet was identical to this but was about 15 years old. (They |||1
do wear out after 15 years of constant use.) Buxton always makes beautiful quality leather goods. I like that the change purse closes with a metal clasp and not a |||1
zipper. I especially like that there is a divided change purse --- I use one side for pennies and the other side for all other coins. Also, I like that |||1
there are two paper money slots ---- I use one side for bills and the other side for checks. (yes I am very organized.) I like this wallet very much. |||1
I absolutely love this wallet. I've had it for about 2-3 weeks and its durable and pretty. It looks exactly like the picture, its got plenty of space. The only |||1
thing I will mention is that in the cash parts, there is an opening, so you can't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there, because it might fall |||1
out. Otherwise its great, there is enough space for a bunch of cards, cash and change. The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great. |||1
I really like this wallet. It has plenty of room for bank cards and I do not have to fold up the bills when I put them in the wallet. |||1
The only thing that I was originally looking for and this did not have it, was to have my ID in a window outside the wallet so I would not |||1
have to open it up in order to show my ID. Aside from that, it was just what I was looking for. |||1
First of all I want to say that it is a lovely, well-made wallet. The problem I have is while it has many slots, it doesn't close well when the |||1
slots are all or even mostly filled. The change purse clasp pops open and so does the snap closure. I am surprised that no else has reported these issues. |||1
Have used this very same ladies wallet two times. It holds everything you need and hold up really well. Will definitely buy this brand and style again. |||1
I've been searching unsuccessfully for a few years for a French purse style wallet, as I do not like the long wallets. This is absolutely PERFECT. Holds everything and is |||1
beautiful to look at. Buxton has always been an excellent brand, and they continue to produce beautiful and functional accessories. I am very happy with my purchase. |||1
you can fill fill fill it and it still has room to close and snap. it is well made and doesn't smell of leather. It says real leather on cards |||1
inside it too!I really like it! perfect size too :)AB |||1
I like the looks of this wallet and especially the color, and all the spaces for cards and your license. The only thing I had a problem with was the |||1
slots for your cards were hard to use. I had alot trouble pulling my cards out, I do like the wallet so I'm going to keep it and hope they |||1
will stretch out a little in time. |||1
The wallet has served me well for the short time I have owned it, however, the stitching holding the picture ID window in place has become loose, is unraveling and |||1
is about 30% detached. It appears the window will become unattached shortly. This unraveling is no doubt a result of having to produce ID several times a week while shopping. |||1
A simple fix would be reinforced stitching in that most used area of the wallet where wear-and-tear are greatest. |||1
When I was a young lady (am now 90), Buxton was a very good name. It hasn't changed today, in my estimation, and I am quite pleased with the wallet |||1
I purchased. |||1
this wallet is absolutely perfect! it holds everything I need, and keeps it all organized. As for size, I would call it a medium sized wallet, it wouldn't be good |||1
for a small purse. |||1
This is the 2nd time I have purchased this wallet. I love it!! It has two places for folding money and a divided coin purse. It also has many slots |||1
for credit cards and other cards you need to keep up with. It also has a place for your driver's license. Buxton makes a good, quality product at a very |||1
reasonable price. |||1
This leather wallet is soft leather, holds cash, cards, and change. It is easy to close and closes tight. Doesn't take up a lot of space in your purse. |||1
Just like all the others, this is the best wallet on the market. Made well and fits all my needs. Who needs a checkbook in the wallert anymore. I just |||1
keep the checkbook in a zipper in my purse for the few times I need it. I like the change purse without a zipper. This should last many many years. |||1
I didn't think it was easy to open or that it stored cards and bills well. I sent it back. |||1
Where do I even begin with how impressed I am with this wallet? It was slightly bigger than I thought it'd be, but when I opened it up, I discovered |||1
why - slots GALORE! There are probably 20 card slots alone all over the inside of this wallet, and there are 2 large pockets and perhaps 3-4 small ones for |||1
receipts, cash, and whatever else you'd like to store inside your wallet. There is a clasped pouch on one side for your change.Overall, this wallet is extremely well-designed and very |||1
useful for those of us who constantly carry a lot of cards with us. The colors are as expected (I got the warm pink shade) and the texture is matte, |||1
smooth and durable. Plus, the price is unbeatable! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and will look into more Buxton wallets in the future. |||1
This wallet is big enough to hold all my credit cards. I also love the two different places you can put your paper money in. Also I love the unique |||1
change purse which is divided pennies on one side and quarters and nickles on the the other side.. Has two clasps on it. One for full wallet and the other |||1
one when less is in it. Nice leather on the outside and good man made material on the inside. Will be buying another in different one as well. |||1
VERY NICE, I LOVE IT, ALSO GOT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES HERS AS WELL! HOLDING UP GREAT SO FAR! |||1
after reading all the reviews I was sure this was the wallet for me. It's very low quality leather and doesn't look well-made. It does have many, many card slots, |||1
but it seems it would break if they were full. Returned it. |||1
I do not recommend this. Only the outer layer is real leather. They use the cheap fake stuff on the inside. THe wallet smells of cheap plastic. I will not |||1
buy this Buxton cheap wallets anymore. |||1
I wanted a small, but reasonable size wallet to fit in my tiny purse, and came across this in Amazon and knew I had to give it a try. The |||1
price and quality makes sense. The pink one looks very classy, although a ltitle bulky, but can't complain...There's many credit card/card compartments and 2 sections where you can put your |||1
bills in (I'd say one is more than enough, but it's there).Overall, great purchase. |||1
I ordered this wallet on a Friday, and I received it the following Tuesday, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I ordered the red one, because red is my favorite color. It |||1
is VERY nicely made. Very roomy, has LOTS of places to carry cards etc. The leather is nice and soft to the touch. I think that I am going to |||1
be VERY pleased with this wallet for years to come. It also came in a very nice box, so that if anyone were getting it for a gift for someone |||1
it would be easy to wrap. |||1
I have been looking for years in stores for a replacement for my 25 year old wallet. I am a creature of habit--and do not trade in ANYTHING lightly. But |||1
you can imagine the looks I got with the one I was carrying, beyond old--it was tearing apart, looked terrible--but until I found EXACTLY what I wanted--it was staying. I |||1
just got finished transferring all my life from that to the new Buxton wallet. Mind you, a wallet to me is a brief history of my life-- where I carry |||1
Catholic holy cards, my NRA life-membership card, pictures of my late husband and drivers licenses dating back 15 years. ALL FIT WITH NO PROBLEM. I am sorry I did not |||1
go on line before last week or I would have found this much sooner. But EVERYTHING, I mean it ALL fit with no problem. HIGHLY recommend. |||1
I didn't like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment. It was also slightly ugly. I sent it back. |||1
Just wish the company had maintained the all leather wallet as opposed to using vinyl on the interior of the wallet. |||1
This is the closest thing I have found to a wonderful compact wallet I bought in Italy and used to death. It appears to be well made and I think |||1
it will stand up to wear. It has as many pockets and compartments as I need. I appreciate the change purse part that opens up with a snap fastener. Many |||1
other wallets have a small gusseted change section that is zippered and doesn't open far enough for you to see what change you have. I wanted something that didn't require |||1
me to empty all the coins out to find what I needed. |||1
Trying to downsize my purse contents and this wallet is perfect. It holds everything that was in my much larger wallet and I love the color. Buxton has been making |||1
quality products for years and they continue to do so. |||1
The card slots in the wallet are too tight. You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out. I used the |||1
wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away. I've gone back to by old wallet. |||1
I love this wallet. It has a capacity that rivals theAlicia Klein Wallet "Park Avenue", and it looks amazing. I think that's all the more reason to give this wallet |||1
a try. |||1
I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift. She was very happy with this product. I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these. |||1
All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product. She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the |||1
well organized compartments in the billfold. She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in |||1
the department stores locally. She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design. Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The |||1
picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page............. |||1
This was on the list of favorites for my girlfriend. She just loved it! It was the right size and color. |||1
This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few' cards in it. The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards |||1
(which includes the drivers license, library card, 2 medical cards, AARP and towing cards-no charge cards) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 |||1
inches apart and will grow if more cards are added. Sorry to say, I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for |||1
me. |||1
I love my new wallet! The color is beautiful and the size is perfect, it is what I was looking for! I am very glad I bought it! Also the |||1
seller was great! Thank you so much! |||1
If the inside pocket isn't weighted down it flips upside down. If it isn't snapped shut in both overlaying flaps everything is all over the ground with the risk of |||1
losing cards and IDs. I even had a nightmare about on my second day of owning this. lol |||1
I love the length of the strap and they way that the bag is organized. You just have to be prepared to have everything falling out all of the time. |||1
I taught a class, and one of my students came into my class carrying my debit card saying that I dropped it in the parking lot. I'm glad someone nice |||1
found it. |||1
There are many things I do love about the purse - the size is perfect. The inside pocket is a nice size. However the upper flap that has slots for |||1
your credit cards is exposed to the outer edge. After using this purse for a couple weeks and taking my debit card in and out, the slot became loose and |||1
my debit card slid out into the unknown and was lost. That is a major design flaw. For that reason alone, I cannot give this purse a higher rating. |||1
has room for what you need to run out of the house, only thing wish the handle was made a little stronger, but overall size is great |||1
I bought this purse because I don't like carrying around a large purse but I need a lot of pockets for all my stuff. This fit the bill perfectly. It's |||1
large enough yet large enough to hold what I need |||1
Actually this bag is made great but it has twice as many places to put cards as I need. I bought it so I would always have a small black |||1
bag and now I do mission accomplished. |||1
This purse is very likeable. It's a handy, small size and the leather is quite soft to touch. The drawback is that the gap at the top when the purse |||1
is clasped is so large little items may fall out. With the price of lipstick these days, I won't chance carrying it loose in this purse! I did keep the |||1
purse, though, thinking I can use it for special occasions when it suits my outfit. On those occasions, I plan to put the smaller items in a cosmetic bag and |||1
carry that inside the purse. |||1
I bought this same wallet last year for myself. My mom liked it so much that I ordered one for her as well. We are both very happy with them. |||1
I carry a Nokia 1520 cell phone and it fits perfectly, even with my checkbook. So easy to stay organized with all the pockets. Its held up pretty well too, |||1
and I'm not overly careful. I would definitely recommend this. |||1
I love this bag as an option to switch to a smaller carry option. The only problem I had was the snap closure is tight and actually pulled out from |||1
the bag when I tried harder to open it. I've pushed it back in but don't use it much because of this. |||1
I bought 4 shoulder wallets. This one is the most organized. The color is not a bright red so it has a soft red color. |||1
I started trying out a red one, then a blue one and the latest is a white one. They look small but it is amazing how much stuff you can |||1
carry in these little buggers without them looking stuffed. They are great and I'm very happy with them! |||1
hoping to use it as large clutch wallet. it's too big for that but too small for a purse for me, an adult woman. It's nicely made so I'm hoping |||1
to use it as a gift for a younger girl.. |||1
I wanted a burgundy to match a tote bag I have, but this is a little too dark. The style is nice, though, with lots of room for the amount |||1
of stuff I carry. I wish the credit card slots were enclosed within the pouch of the bag for more security. I ordered a credit card stacker to play it |||1
safe. Overall, it's a nice mini bag for carrying cash,cards and my smartphone.05/05: Today I tried to open the inner flap and the clasp was stuck fast and I ended |||1
up tearing it. Too bad because the red one I have is still doing fine with normal wear. |||1
As with any Buxton product this is a fine quality leather clutch. Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Tastefully designed and nice and roomy with plenty of |||1
dividers and zippered pockets etc. |||1
Buxton is my go-to for wallets. They have so many compartments that are perfect for all the things you need/want to carry in your wallet. This taupe color is very |||1
pretty & goes with any handbag I carry. Buxton is always a great product! |||1
This is one of my favorite orders from Amazon and it a great wallet and high quality. I will look for a purse to match. |||1
Great wallet, plenty of room for cards, and anything you need in your wallet, holds checkbook and register, only thing can not pull them out. Very well made leather on |||1
outside very soft, pretty sure wallet will last a long time |||1
The check holder I received with this clutch was not removable, thus limiting its use for me, since my husband and I share the checks. I returned it to Amazon, |||1
a company that is the most cooperative I deal with. |||1
This is the best wallet I have ever bought and I am a purse and wallet freak. Look good and fits all. |||1
Beautifully made with high quality materials. Very nice and at a low price. It had many more pockets and compartments than were apparent from the pictures and descriptions. Am thinking |||1
of getting another one as a spare. |||1
My sister and I purchased this clutch and we both love it. The features are great and the clutch color is so rich looking, I would highly recommend....in any color. |||1
I love this billfold! It is large & has many compartments and slots. I love the zip around closure as well. |||1
I always come back to Buxton for wallets. This one has a place for everything, and I do mean everything! I really like the currency compartment--there are two slots for |||1
bills and a center zippered compartment for coins, receipts, or large denominations. There's also a change pouch in front for easy access. There are almost enough card slots, and there |||1
are a number of plastic sleeves if you run out of slots. For some reason the slots are not of uniform size and I had to do some finagling to |||1
make some of my cards fit. I also wish the snap flap went over the currency compartment so I didn't have to keep it zipped, but I'll get used to |||1
it, and I'm sure the leather slots will loosen up with use.After an exhaustive online and in store search, I've decided that this clutch gives the best bang for the |||1
buck. Mine is red, and it's a rich, not fire engine color. I'm very pleased. |||1
This clutch wallet passed my expectations, very happy with this wallet. The color and suede feel is a great plus. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a |||1
great clutch wallet at a reasonable price. In similar products, other clutch book wallets would not have as much available space, for all items needed to be placed in the |||1
wallet. The size can fit into any pocketbook without the bulge when filled, a deep pocket, or used as a carry-along without pocketbook. This clutch is great, and would not |||1
be a disappointment to anyone who is looking for this type of wallet. I Love It!!! |||1
I originally ordered three wallets. This was the one I initially liked the best, but the one of the zippered compartments was too small for dollar bills, and the zipper |||1
would separate when zipped. I sent it back and kept the Visconti Heritage T-35. |||1
To me it appears almost brown rather than mahogany. It is well made and functional and the price is quite good. |||1
This is a wallet every woman should own. I can put everything I had in my previous wallet and much more that I can add to this new wallet. It |||1
is leather. I would order it again. |||1
This is very pretty and the leather is very soft. It is going to be a great gift for someone special! |||1
I'm really impressed with this clutch. It make for a wonderful alternative for something lie theAlicia Klein Wallet "Park Avenue". It's easy to carry around and it can handle anything |||1
a wallet to best of its ability. I think it's a terrific item to have. |||1
I think this is such a great wallet! Fit everything I needed it to! Great color! Love the leather! Matches my new bag perfectly |||1
I was shock on the price of this clutch and what quality I received . Excellence can only describe how pretty and soft the leather is . I have so |||1
much pain in my hands , soft leather is a treat to me. |||1
I have had several zip around clutch wallets and it is the style I prefer. The color is not fire engine red just a nice red color. The leather is |||1
medium soft with a nice feel to it. Love all the card holding spots and the area for a check book is easily used for something else. The snap closure |||1
is handy and keeps everything in place, you can access your money without having to open the clutch, just open the zippered area. Having a zipper change pocket on the |||1
side is so handy or you can use the zipper pocket in the zip around. When all filled I still found this Buxton clutch to be fairly slim. I'm very |||1
pleased with this clutch and would buy it again. |||1
These don't give me much support but I did not really expect them to. I wear a 32D and ordered a size C they covered perfectly. I feel like this |||1
may work better if you are fuller on top. I'm fuller on bottom and the tabs just pull the skin and makes me look wrinkly. They did give me some |||1
support, however they also made a strange cone shape and made me look quite pointy. I would wear these with something that already has some support or is a thicker |||1
fabric. However, they will definitely come in handy with certain outfits and would be perfect for a special occasion dress that already has some structure. |||1
I am a 34 C. You have to play with them at first to get the look you want, but once you do, they are awesome. They look like I |||1
have perky boobs with no bra. Be patient though. Also, they may not work so well with thin fabrics. . . makes the skin look kind of wrinkly. |||1
You do have to trim them with a scissor to make them a suitable size for your own body shape and the clothing you are wearing them with. They provide |||1
just enough lift, but don't expect them to make you look like you're wearing a full bra. They just reduce the jiggle and hold you in place. |||1
These definitely take practice to apply without leaving wrinkles. We had to cut this to size so nothing peeks out. Got lucky as it worked the first time! |||1
Large chest women cannot wear theses.You know how difficult it is to tape things, just imagine your boobs.I had to try for only $10. I wrote the review so you |||1
don't have too.And I only intended to wear these with a strapless bra for more support, not alone so I was not expecting too much. |||1
I wear a 40DD but got the 40DDD instead since it was my first time ordering bras from Amazon. The fit would have been ideal if it wasn't padded. Women |||1
who already have large enough 'girls' do not need the padding. The bra looks perfect online, however, the workmanship left much to be desired. For example, the black lace flowers |||1
design that covers the beige material needed some more attention to be paid to it. While the flowers were pretty, each flower bud and petal had thread sticking out (the |||1
flowers are sewn on). All the manufacturers had to do was just clip off the extra pieces of thread. I plan to do just that. |||1
this bra is really comfy and supportive. the only downside i have is that it actually rides a little high, so you can't wear it with lower cut tops or |||1
it will show. |||1
This bra is one of the most comfortable garments I've purchased in a very long time. It provides the support I want while being comfortable and quite pretty also. I |||1
have been purchasing bras at a much higher price, they were excellent; however, at this price and the satisfaction with the garment I'll be happy to purchase this item again. |||1
This bra fits properly and is beautiful. It's nice to find a pretty bra in larger sizes. Most of the pretty one stop at size 40. |||1
I love this bra. doesnt ride under arm or didn't even need any adjusting. Plan to buy a few more soon |||1
I ordered the black one first and was so pleased with it that I ordered the navy one. Love the satin finish on the back. VERY comfortable with GREAT support |||1
and coverage. If the rating went to 10 stars, I'd try to give 11. :-) |||1
Love, love, love this bra. It fits well, the underwire doesn't poke into my arm, and the bra cup stays put. I wear it all day long and it is |||1
still comfortable at the end of the day. I usually get home from work thinking "I can't WAIT to get this bra off." Not with this one. It's pretty and |||1
it fits and it's very comfortable. |||1
This bra fits perfect and I bought it to go with my blue dress. It looks so sexy to, love it |||1
I'm usually a fan of playtex but this one just didn't cut it for me. I had to return it because it was so uncomfortable on me. There was no |||1
problem with the return. I appreciate that. |||1
Lovely, fits, and the lace pattern is gorgeous. Only 4 stars because I had to bend the underwire in the middle to make it not poke me in the underarm. |||1
The bra is certainly not one you want to wear out to the club or for good cleavage. It's incredibly comfortable and one of my favorite bras for lazy days. |||1
However, if you want to show the girls off, I suggest something else. |||1
I am a 38D in all bras, Victoria Secret, Playtex, Beyond Bare, but this one is way tooooooo tight. The cups are also a little too small, and yes, as |||1
another reviewer mentioned, I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too. I would not recommend. I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one. |||1
This bra quickly became my favorite. I wear it practically every day. It's so comfortable and seamless! I can wear thin shirts and there are no bra-lines showing. Love it. |||1
Bought a 40DDD. This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy. It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - |||1
of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very |||1
uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again. |||1
The bra fits well but the cups are far larger than desired. Your boobs won't just flop around, they'll look freaky. |||1
This was a gift. This was excelent and like it. Playtex is good. They arrived on time and has the quality and desing that amazons offers. |||1
It is everything as described, however, for me that bra did not cover everything as I expected. Pretty, comfortable. Can also be used as a one size up pusher bra |||1
because it is thick enough, but it is not thick thick. I recommend it. My girlfriend liked it too. |||1
This bra is incredibly comfortable, and at least for me, it is true to size. I am deployed in Afghanistan, so I do not have the luxury of trying items |||1
on before I buy, therefore, I am very impressed with the fit and will be ordering more of this exact bra, but in different colors. The shoulder straps are a |||1
perfect width - not too thick or thin. And the back strap is a good width for support and keeps "bra muffin top" away :) |||1
The bra is nice but I didnt like it because it gives your boobs that old school pointy look and I have never liked that. |||1
this is a great bra. it was so soft and comfortable I really like it. I will be buying more in the future and do recommend it toothers. |||1
I purchased this slip in a dept store many years ago, & it has stood the test of time very well. Now, it is nowhere to be found locally. But |||1
trusty ol' Amazon has it! Yay! Ordered 2. Black & neutral. So happy to find this item. Ordered by my bust size. Perfect fit! |||1
Washes and dries well in the dryer. Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash. This is the best lace full slip. I will be ordering another |||1
one. |||1
This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around |||1
the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially |||1
in this case. |||1
This slip is going to work great under a light colored summer dress. Slip is the perfect length for the dress and fits just as expected. |||1
My Mother has difficulties getting out to shop. We found this, knew the brand was a good brand, ordered it and it was just what she wanted. |||1
Probably my fault but this was way shorter than I expected. I kept it because I'm sure I can use it in the future but I need to order a |||1
longer one. |||1
Really like this slip but it runs smaller than my size. I even ordered a size larger than I normally wear. The slip "clings" to your body but does not |||1
seem to ride up when wearing. I would definitely buy again but will purchase two sizes larger next time. |||1
The fit was good ITS A SLIP WHAT CAN YOU SAY THE ITEM ARRIVED AFTER I NEEDED BUT THAT WAS FINE |||1
This is a very nice, well made slip. I plan to order one in a longer version. Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts. I |||1
would recommend this. The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me. I got it just when I needed it. |||1
Needed another slip for a trapeze dress and this worked. I wear a 22 and its a bit snug. Other than that, it works. |||1
Because this item was so inexpensive, I was not expecting much. To my surprise, it was of decent quality. It's not a luxury item by any means, but it works |||1
fine for my purposes. I'm 5' and weigh about 110lbs, with a 34D bra size. I ordered the small, and it fit me quite well. |||1
This slip was the most economical I could find online. I rarely need a full slip so I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. It's comfortable, cool |||1
(that was my biggest thing), and fits well. The straps do tend to fall down a little bit but you could easily stitch them in place. I don't see this |||1
lasting 20 years like my mom's Vanity Fair slip, but I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it! |||1
I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early. The package was in excellent shape. I am very happy with Amazon Prime |||1
delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip. The fit |||1
is excellent and the length was just what I expected. I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black. I wish there were more color |||1
options than just black and white. I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them. |||1
My second time purchasing this item. I wear it under dresses as a slip is supposed to be worn and it does the job perfectly. I can't believe how hard |||1
slips are to find and this one is perfect for the job. |||1
I recently bought several wrap and faux-wrap dresses that could show off WAY too much leg if there's a slight breeze, so I needed something a bit modest to spare |||1
the world a view of my blindingly white legs. This slip works PERFECTLY. It's beautiful and comfortable. It also makes me feel a bit like a '40s film star. Women |||1
need to dress like this more often!The fit: I ordered my bra size. I've got that lovely pear shape going, and it still fit perfectly over my hips. I'd order |||1
more colors (I got the black), but they're all out of stock! Bummer. |||1
This slip is awesome, I love in particular how it fits across my chest. I love the fabric, I love the length and it came very promptly in the mail. |||1
It's a nice slip to have for a nightgown or for any other occasion. Defintely recommend this buy :) |||1
Had to return. Will have to find a place that sells full-size slips to try on. Don't use Victoria's Secret, they are way expensive. |||1
i am 5'3 and this slip is right in the middle of my knee and very long. it was cheap so i'm keeping it, but the length will limit me |||1
from wearing this often with most of my dresses that are right above the knee level. |||1
This slip is exactly what I was looking for. Traditional styling that you don't see much of anymore. The only drawback is the length is too long and not adjustable. |||1
I bought what I thought was a shorter length and it wasn't. |||1
It fits really well. It stays where in place. It's not bulky at all. Hidden under my dress and is actually kind of comfy. |||1
The slip arrived on time and was just as I expected. It fits true to size. I wanted to wear it under a dress that exposes the top part of |||1
the slip, but it just looks too much like a slip. I will definitely use it as a slip, but I want to try and get something else for under |||1
this totally sheer dress. I tried wearing a camisole, but it didn't work at all with this dress, |||1
This is a wonderful slip. The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements. Excellent value! |||1
These are great. They go on how they should and they stay the whole day. I'm pretty sure they'd stay a whole week if I wanted them to. They're very |||1
cute too! One note -- if the fabric you're wearing is white or somewhat sheer, you might want to buy tan petals instead, as the pink is very light and |||1
will show through as a white bra would. |||1
I am wearing a wire bra in a parade and don't want any wardrobe malfunctions. After buying two other more expensive pairs, one too light (who would have thought that |||1
Jennifer Lopez was considered "dark") and one whose reviewers swore it was adhesive and it wasn't , I finally found these again and they arrived quickly . I'm SO pleased!!!!! |||1
That I sweat a lot and my skin pores were itching, I have a problem with my skin breathing, how ever they did not come off.....I did end up having |||1
a nice irritated skin. |||1
These work very well. Love the color and the feel. Stick on very smooth and can't see under clothing unless it's a light colored thin shirt. Best I've found for |||1
the price. Very easy on the skin and easy to take off, no pain at all, and stay on all day long. Middles sometimes tend to puff out if sitting |||1
or laying a certain way but go back when standing up. Great for the price and no pain when removing! |||1
These fit wonderfully, very indiscreet, and I didnt feel them at all. There was no pull when taking them off. Very nice, I would buy again. |||1
The pink color was very faint - almost white. The quality on these was a little disappointing as well. The little pad in the middle was way off-center on almost |||1
every one. They didn't stick as well as other brands i've tried as well. Would not buy again. |||1
Love these for helping to hide that bit of exposure that always seems to attract the wrong "attention". Completes the look. |||1
I made a Halloween costume, but it soon became apparent that the inside wasn't padded well enough... Ordered these pretty much last-minute, got them the day of the party, and |||1
I must say that they certainly did their job! I couldn't even tell I was wearing them, either. After the party, I ended up falling asleep with them on, and |||1
even then when I went to take them off the next day, it didn't hurt at all. It pulled just a tiny bit, like pulling off one of those cheap |||1
bandaids with really weak adhesive. Also, they hadn't come off at all during the night, and I toss and turn a lot when I sleep, so they seem to last |||1
well.I was wearing something with a little bit of padding, so I can't speak for how well they will do underneath something very thin, like whether or not the edges |||1
will show. |||1
When looking for a solid pair of pantyhose I look no further than Berkshire Silky. These are high quality and durable. I love the little extra shine on them, it |||1
adds a lot of class.I also love all of the colour options. They have a lot of types of nudes that are wonderful. I have every colour and love them |||1
all.I would recommend these to anyone looking for an awesome pair of nylons. |||1
These do not bind or roll, perfect for dressing up or wearing to an office. I will buy these again! |||1
I ordred Queen size....It looks like my child's 6x tights. It's no way I could get a leg into these. |||1
I am so happy with these... they feel great and very sturdy. The sizing chart was accurate... I am 5'6/200 and I ordered 1x/2x which fit fine. The control top |||1
is very comfortable compared to other brands. The fabric is very smooth, not too flimsy but not suffocatingly thick either. It also is not snagging like other nylons, nor do |||1
I notice any pilling. They are so comfortable, and I expect to get many more wears out of these. I am so impressed with these I just bought 2 more |||1
pairs. |||1
These held up to me very well. I wore them 3 or 4 times before I ripped them. I 'm kind of rough with hosiery. |||1
The product was large, but I am glad I purchased them , they are very roomy indeed. Great Price and I will order again. |||1
these are the most durable ph i have ever bought, they come in aarray of colors ultra sheer to opaque, designs.. something for everywomen in you |||1
These fit nicely and are very comfortable. Great product and excellent value. What else can be said about pantyhose?? They fit and stay put |||1
have not worn them yet but i like the color and if they fit like the ones i had before they will fit quite well |||1
I hate panty hose. I bought these because for my size I was told this was the best brand. They fit fine, didn't ride up or roll down, and didn't |||1
bunch up around the legs. Won't plan on wearing again but it's good enough for the one time I needed them. |||1
Sure it fits snug - but that's what it is supposed to do! Also, the garters are wonderful, only one has ripped, but it is easily sewn back together. It |||1
makes everything smooth underneath clothes, and is just a fun thing to wear! It has a lot of stretch to it, so that's good for me; I recommend for any |||1
lady pursuing the glamour of the 1950s! |||1
This is my second garter from Rago and it's amazing. If you're looking for shapewear, this is the brand you want. Don't bother with Spanx, they're not gonna hold you |||1
in. They'll smooth all the lines, but this one will give you the firmed up, 1950s look. I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I'm not the only girl |||1
who wears Rago!Also, I'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me. Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway, Rago is an amazing brand, please don't |||1
hesitate to get something from them. <3 |||1
Very sexy and gives nice finished look under your favorite retro dress. I love it. Pulls in without rolling down at the waist or hiking up. Nicely made. |||1
Purchased this to wear under a formal dress for a wedding. The control and slimming aspects are outstanding; really made my dress hang well. Unfortunately, every time I sat down, |||1
the bottom would ride up so once I stood again I would need to slip into the ladies' room to pull it back down. I avoided anything with a seat |||1
because it becomes so cumbersome to go to the bathroom and thought this would be a good alternative but it was not. I would buy a Ragu product again just |||1
not this style. |||1
I wear a rago 1359 obg every day. with it on I have a flat tummy again. Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to |||1
help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it |||1
is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on. |||1
I thought the hooks were too small for my bra straps- but a kind commenter helped me out. I now realize they wrap around the bra strap and hook to |||1
themselves. So now that I know how to use the strap it works well but is not super comfortable. I'd recommend it still though because it beats having your straps |||1
fall down. |||1
For $7 you get 4 of these things - what more can you ask? I bought these as opposed to buying new racerback bras. They are certainly tricky to install |||1
- probably best if you ask a friend for help. BUT once in place, they work really well to keep your straps in place, and if you have a top |||1
or dress that dips in a little as I do, they are great for helping to hide your straps! The beige color is more of an ivory than a nude, |||1
which was my only disappointment. But glad I got them! |||1
This is a great idea, but they are very hard to put on by yourself, and they pop off real easily. |||1
This strap gets the job done, but the clasps come undone very easily for me. And if I do get my bra on without the clasps coming undone, I usually |||1
have to do some super-secret-acrobatic trick maneuvers to move the strap to the position I would like it to be. But honestly, a great solution for a common problem, to |||1
that I say "Kudos!" |||1
So, I love the idea here, but there are some considerations. First, the S/M is more for training bras or people who are very small/petite. So, I wish they would |||1
just call it Small rather than S/M. I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.Second, the right fit is |||1
important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder |||1
blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a |||1
swinging strap on your back.Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not. But it's not as revolutionary as I thought it would be. :) I'm |||1
still waiting for a better solution. |||1
They serve their purpose to keep bra straps on the shoulders. They were what I expected them to be, period. |||1
I was somewhat skeptical about these straps and I have to admit that it took me a few minutes to figure out how to attach them to my bra, even |||1
after looking at the picture on the package. They work GREAT!!!! I gave the clear strap to one of my co-workers to try out and she loves them too. The |||1
only drawback is that you have to keep it attached and put your bra on over your head and hook your bra from behind. BUT, if it keeps my bra |||1
straps up all day long I will do anything!!!!!!! I am very happy with the product and I ordered the L/XL variety pack with 4 different colored straps. I wear |||1
a size 34-B bra so I would expect that unless you are a size 0 that most women would need the L/XL size. |||1
A perfect fit for grandmother to wear daily. Easy to wash and dry and fabric was comfortable for daily wear |||1
This night gown is very pretty and a nice clear shade of red. It is comfy in terms of fit but the fabric makes it clingy and warm specially on |||1
a humid night. I was hoping for a breezy, cool nightgown and should have paid more attention to the description of the fabric |||1
I have been buying Shadowline night gowns for years. They took the place of the Vanity Fair ones I use to be able to find. With this recent purchase I |||1
noticed that the fabric IS a lighter weight compared to my other Shadlowline gowns. Maybe the company is trying to cut down on their cost and therefore using lighter weight |||1
fabric. Either way I love the color and am happy with it. If they go any lighter in the fabric weight I will NOT buy anymore. |||1
Great gown and the material is wonderful. Bought the red and petal pink. Red bold, pink deep. These are quality. Little long bare foot, but perfect length in slippers. 5'3" |||1
Will come back and purchase other colors and from this company bought darker colors due to not wanting to be sheer looking in the light. These are what I wanted. |||1
Wash delicate HE machine and use Tyler detergent. Hang to air dry. Then quick fluff in air HE dryer. Wonderfull in feel and fragrance. |||1
This gown is very well made and great weight. I have other Shadowline gowns and they wash well and color stays true. I would recommend this product to others. |||1
A little too transparent. Not so bad that I can't wear it. Pretty color. Size seems true. Mine was "soft peach". A nice color. |||1
I was amazed at the quality of this night gown. The nylon was not the thin flimsy material that you usually see but a nice weight that should hold up |||1
well. It washed up beautifully and came out of the dryer wrinkle free . The fit was very accurate and the length was just right . I'm 5ft 3inch and |||1
it was perfect! I plan to order other colors and these usually sell for much more! |||1
I can understand why this affordable nightgown received positive reviews but it is too thin to wear outside of the bedroom in my opinion. |||1
I was happy to see this style of gown that is almost impossible to find in a store. I had several that were identical to this made by Vanity Fair |||1
years ago. They were the best gowns ever. This one by Shadowline is a close second. It's comfortable and lasts a few years before fading. I have the sapphire color |||1
which is not see-through. The lighter colors are see-through. It's made in Mexico. |||1
Love the color and this gown washes so nicely. Nice and long to give that extra warmth and keeps the shape really nice too. |||1
Love this beautiful nightgown. I was looking for a pretty but practical peignoir set which is surprisingly hard to find, and I settled on this nightgown with the matching robe. |||1
I am 5'7" 150 lbs and wasn't sure whether to get the medium or large. I played it safe and went for the large, but its a bit big and |||1
I think the medium would have fit well, at least for the nightgown. I would probably still choose the large robe. The rosy pink is a beautiful deep pink, the |||1
gown is the perfect weight for wearing and feels wonderful on. I knock off a star however because as others have mentioned, it is too sheer to wear without the |||1
robe, at least for me. I plan to order the short set for summer wear. Maybe several! |||1
All the Shadowline products I have purchased fit perfect and the gown or robes have been well made. I would buy Shadowline products again. |||1
Very elegant looking gown. Fits nicely. Washed up very well. Packed well for travel. Would definitely purchase this gown again. |||1
I bought this for my elder mother, who wanted a LONG nightgown. Turns out it was a little too long for her :-) and I hand hemmed it. Not a |||1
big deal. she is very particular about the length of her gowns. Quite a pretty gown, nice color, nice neckline and coverage....only wish the fabric was not so thin! |||1
This gown is generous in fit, soft, washes up beautifully and comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles and packs easily. I would suggest going down one size if |||1
you are between 1x and 2x. The color is exactly the way the photo shows and is a deep hot pink color. I bought the matching robe as well and |||1
the same can be said about it as the nightgown. I do not find it cool to sleep in, as other reviewers mentioned, but it is certainly comfortable and pretty |||1
enough to wear it around the house and especially when visiting friends and you want something to throw on quickly to make those bathroom trips in the middle of the |||1
night! The style is rather matronly, and is suitable for mixed company or when you need something simple to wear while getting coffee in the morning. |||1
surprisingly warm and soft feeling. Beautiful, good price, an excellent buy for anyone to enjoy. I love it anytime, any place. |||1
I have bought Shadowline long gowns for several years. I love the colorsthey are so comfortable and last for a long time. Own almost all the colors.THEY ARE WONDERFUL AND |||1
BEAUTIFUL |||1
Having previously purchased a Shadowline long gown in 2002....I was in desperate need of a new one...with red being my favorite of colors, this was a no brainer. A red |||1
Shadowline...hands down!My previous purchase was from a local upscale dept store and through the years it has seen it's share of some rips and tears; however it is still together, |||1
just a lot of wearing, but I will not part with it even though it has now been retired.I'm so glad this item was available...and will be a continued customer |||1
of Shadowline (until maybe I have every color) and Amazon...amazing service ~ |||1
I like to put this on when I get up as a coverup when I make breakfast. Pretty looking gown. |||1
Since a few customers have commented that the quality has changed- and I have NOT found this to be the case, I want to include some information from a comment |||1
by one of the sellers. It will be after my own review. I have worn these gowns for more than 20 years. I used to purchase them at Dillard's Dept. |||1
Stores, but they quit selling them some years ago. I was so happy to find them available here on Amazon because absolutely NOTHING I have found, for any amount of |||1
money, has been as nice as the Shadowline. The pale pink, peach, and periwinkle are not quite as opaque as the other colors but I do not find anything unusual |||1
about that (think white pants!). If you find the darker colors to be too revealing, you should probably consider flannel nightgowns. Just saying. :-)___________________Shoppers please note: There was a short |||1
period of time (late 2011) when Shadowline used a different fabric for the Petals gowns in Holly Red and Deep Lavender. It was not as nice as their traditional Opacitrique |||1
fabric. When they changed this in 2012 (and changed the color names to Red and Purple), the listings got mixed up here and were combined into the same page (for |||1
Purple and Deep Lavender). ALL of the new Petals gowns are made from the same fabric now, which is their trademarked Opacitrique fabric--the original Shadowline Petals fabric. The new owner |||1
is extremely picky about the quality of his products. And I believe the Deep Lavender and Purple are now the same gowns. If you have doubts, it is a simple |||1
matter to contact the seller of whichever size & color you are viewing and ask them whether it is Opacitrique fabric: select a size and color, then click on the |||1
seller's name that shows up. On the right side of the page, scroll down to the link that says Contact Seller. Hope this helps! |||1
I bought this for my Daughter in Law for Christmas. She has worn Shadowline gowns for several years and appreciates that the fabric is heavy enough that she can go |||1
around the house with the young children with out worrying about having to put on a robe first. The gowns are comfortable as well as durable. Had difficulty finding them |||1
for the past year or so and understand the company has changed hands, but these gowns appear to be equal in quality as the older ones she has. |||1
Just like the green one I ordered earlier, fits great. Good weight, decent for walking the house, but feminine. I love Shadowline ANYTHING. |||1
the color is as beautiful as in the picture and very very comfortable. fast shipment also. worth the money spent |||1
I love the Shadowline nightgowns because they're comfortable & the fabric is usually thicker than similar nightgowns by other manufacturers -- the only complaint I have about this one is |||1
that the fabric is lighter weight in this rich purple color -- the lighter colors use the thicker fabric and they should've used the same fabric for the purple -- |||1
the lighter the nylon fabric is, the more static-prone they are -- not so terrible, but an issue nonetheless. |||1
Well made with opaque fabric of a good weight. Past reviews extolling the fabric convinced me, and the design is attractive. If it came in another color in my size, |||1
I'd buy it. |||1
The gown flows beautifully. Very comfortable with no itchy seams or tags. Elegant and worth the money I highly recommend this item.. |||1
By accident I purchased my first Shadowline gown back in 1995. Have been buying them ever since. They are the best gowns. Material is soft...and wears like iron. The length |||1
is perfect. I love my gowns long.....not ankle length. I am 5'6" and the gown brushes the top of my foot. This gown is worth the money. |||1
I have a 96 year old Mother who still wears girdles with garters. Therefore, I could not find any "standalone" stockings at all; Everything is now a pantyhose. I tried |||1
these stockings first to see if I could get a color match and size. She loved them, so I ordered more. |||1
they fit really good and they feel fantastic on my legs. love wearing them..will buy more. they make my legs feel sexy |||1
Bought these for my girlfriend. They are not her choice but she wears them for me. Definitely a long of fun compared to panty hose. I don't think you will |||1
find a better bang for your buck. Don't forget the garter belt! |||1
I am 5'6", 130 lbs, and I opted for the shorter stockings. I'm glad I did, as the larger size would've been WAY too long. These have a nice feel |||1
to them, and although I've only worn them once, they seem as though they'll last a while. I'm happy with the purchase. |||1
Truly terrible. I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use. |||1
Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even |||1
though they fit. Also, I found them to be very sheer. I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black' that they would be more like tights in color but that |||1
was not the case. Overall, very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund. |||1
I find "control top" pantyhose very uncomfortable. Thigh-highs are the best solution, and these are reasonably priced. I ordered one size up as I have large sized thighs (I am |||1
"pear shaped"). The color, "nude," is a bit whitish for my needs. I have medium color caucasian-type skin. |||1
These are really ice hose. I am short and plump and they fit great. They are actually true to size. |||1
Most thigh highs seem a bit short for my big legs, but these are perfect for me. |||1
At the moment, I can only wear nylons on one leg.The other foot is still wrapped from surgery and will befor another few months.I recommend these stockings even if you |||1
can use both.They stay up without garters or garter belts. No need forpantyhose. The elastic is firm but not too tight.I may use them when I have the use of |||1
both legs. |||1
The stockings are excellent quality and I am very pleased with them and will probably buy more in the future. |||1
I have been on the prowl for thigh highs that do not have the very uncomfortable synthetic material to hold them into place. I thought these were it, but I |||1
was wrong - I failed to read the "Elastic leg bands for stay-put support" part, but I did not give them 4 stars due to my human error. They received |||1
4 stars because the "fantasy black" was hella black, barely sheer. Maybe the "off black" would have provided the sheerness I was looking for.I thought about keeping them any way, |||1
but I finally found what I believe to be a pair of Berkshire thigh highs with lace and without thigh choking rubber involved so I'm sending these Sheer Thigh Highs |||1
back. If these are the kind of thigh highs you are in the market for, I suggest ordering a size up because my thighs are small - I'm 5'4", 120 |||1
lbs - and the C-D still dug in enough to create that unsightly bulge at the top. I believe if they were one size larger, they would still stay in |||1
place and be flattering and somewhat comfortable at the same time. |||1
I've always liked Berkshire hosiery and these thigh highs are good. I ordered queen size but my thighs are small so they were a little big, but I could still |||1
wear them and they did not fall. |||1
Well I guess thy r ok but the stockings had a run in them after only 1 use and the skin under where the rubbery part is that holds them |||1
up was really sore after wearing them so um I'm not going to so I guess the run in them dues not really matter just if u have sensitive skin |||1
u may want to not get those. |||1
Great my girlfriend loves these and enjoyed them for work, very professional and classy she gets complements at her work. |||1
SURPRISINGLY THESE STOCKINGS ARE WONDERFUL !MY Lady loves the way they feel on and they actually stay up on her Big ThighsWOOO ! HOOO ! |||1
This bra fits true to size and is comfortable. I was able to find this via the id number on the tag of my old bra. Thank you Amazon for |||1
making searching for items easy and having a better price! |||1
I am a solid 32DDD. I've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board. This bra has this weird extra nipple room |||1
that I did not need. I'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly. It isn't that the cup is too big, it's only this |||1
extra nipple space. The bra is also scratchy. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again. |||1
I cannot wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room, and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect. I wouldn't compare it |||1
to the torpedo boobs you'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes, but it definitely does give a point to the breasts. I will only be able to wear this |||1
bra with clothing that is thicker, like sweaters, or dresses that are double layered or have thick material. I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra. This bra is AMAZING. |||1
The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also, the cups go very high on the breast, covering almost the entire breast, making it illogical |||1
to wear with anything that shows even a little chest (not breast) because the bra is visible. The Wacoal bra is unbelievably comfortable and only a tad bit more in |||1
price. |||1
I normally wear a 42 B but I had to buy a C in this. It fit but man is it scratchy material! |||1
Although the cups of my 32D fit, the back measurment is not right. The bra will only fit around my back in the very last hook, which means that when |||1
the back stretches, the bra becomes useless because there's no where to go with the hooks. It should have been made to fit on the very first hooks, so that |||1
I could always move in if I needed to. |||1
I'm wearing this bra as I type this rating. It fits very well, and is extremely comfortable to wear. I disagree with some of the other reviews that say this |||1
bra is "scratchy" - not at all! Very smooth feeling and well made. I will purchase more. |||1
Been wearing this bra for many years, recently lost weight but cant wear a C cup.Looks great, that is what you expect from Bali |||1
Great bra for the money, I just wish there where more colors to choose from for my size. Its great. |||1
I have to start out by saying, I thought this was the brand of bra I have been wearing for the last 8 years, (it looks exactly like what I |||1
wear) I didn't realize mine is a different brand until after I placed my order.. I am Sooo Happy I did order this Bali!! The fit (for me) is perfect!! |||1
It stays in place, the back is "U" shaped so I don't have to keep adjusting it through out the day!! It has GREAT SUPPORT, (I'm 64 yrs. old, 5' |||1
5", 137lbs). I purchased a few T-shirts at the beginning of summer, little did I know how clingy they would be (I almost sent them back) with this Bali Bra |||1
however, I look great in those T's!!! I LOVE "This Bali" Soooo Much Better than my brand!!! I LOVE the U shaped back, I love the support, I love the |||1
comfort, and I Love the way I Look with this Bali Bra!!! I can't wait to buy more!!! Thank You Amazon and Under Moments!!! |||1
I've purchased this bra for many years. It is never my only purchase. I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true |||1
shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach |||1
area look thicker, and your torso shorter. With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at |||1
the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have |||1
soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of "give." |||1
They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy |||1
the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare. You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even |||1
the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful "stays" on either side of the bra. These push |||1
you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad |||1
not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra. Inexpensive doesn't |||1
mean it is "cheaply made." Remember to lean fully forward while making the connections so you distribute tissue. Enjoy this purchase. Cindy T. God Bless |||1
Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering |||1
with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with "flowy" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the |||1
shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It |||1
puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for |||1
return shipping is quite a waste. |||1
Great fit and super comfortable. Never rides up my back and wide padded shoulder straps are great. Plan on buying several more! |||1
great support for running, I have worn this ugly bra for 20 years, it has the best support and comfort. |||1
I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price. It's going back.The bra is thin |||1
with old fashioned pointed nipples. The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions, causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose. It felt uncomfortable (not |||1
too tight - just too rough) as soon as I put it on.Because it's a Bali, it's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but |||1
I just can't get over the positive reviews so I'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra, try a Victoria's Secrets wireless cotton bra. |||1
It gives you the smooth coverage you want, excellent support, and you won't even know you are wearing it. |||1
I am enjoying my new bra. Well I have been buying Bali bras for years. I have been very satisfied with them. I would continue to buy tthis product. |||1
Nipples Upward and fashion backwards, this bra is a blast from the past that takes getting used to for those of us with larger endowments (40D and up). Usually I |||1
am trying to slightly minimize the overwhelming appearance of my chest (I wear anywhere from a 38G-44C, depending on the brassiere manufacturer), but this rather comfortable buttressed wonder is "an |||1
all signs point to two Kilmanjaros" kind of affair!The sort of high-construct, seamed directly-over-the-nipples cups, heavy-duty, thick-banded bra that macho litterati Ernest Hemmingway and Mickey Spillane would have waxed over, |||1
and the Godfather of bras, Howard Hughes would have machinated. And while it does fit great (though runs large), and makeS you feel sexy as all get out, it does |||1
NOT work with about 75% of my wardrobe, or most modern wardrobes I would venture, as clingy knits, spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day. The back |||1
band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin, drapey fabric, and that's with the correct size; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these |||1
Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively, I decided to keep it anyway. Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable (but not the upwards-pointing nipples!). Hell, I might even |||1
buy another one in the suggestively named navy, "Midnight." You could run without bouncing with the bulls in this! Spain is waiting. |||1
Dave's wife:I bought this bra at a local small business and haven't been able to find the petite band size I need since then. I finally found it on Amazon |||1
for a better price than I paid in-store. Thank you, Amazon! |||1
The Bali Flower Underwire Bra is the most worn Bra I have ever worn. I have several colors to wear and have never gone wrong with my attire. The underwire |||1
is uplifting and very comfortable |||1
Myself and my girls are just loving this bra, they fit comfortable and i feel lifted. I would recommend this bra to all the ladies in the house with no |||1
regrets this is a wonderful buy |||1
I almost always order Bali bras because they are true to size. I ordered 44DDD and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day. After |||1
about 5 hours the underwire started to poke under my arms. I much prefer not to wear any bra with an underwire because they are notoriously uncomfortable, but apparently there |||1
are none in my size. The covering on the underwire is quite soft and cushiony but still the wires poke through into my under arms. I am disappointed but maybe |||1
I am ordering the wrong size. |||1
Have owned this name of bra for quite awahile and would't wear a different good style fit and price. good uplift |||1
I love this brand and make because I needed something that would give me good coverage. And it does. It looks good when wearing blouses and shirts. |||1
The rings and adjusters are plastic in the DD's and below which I don't like, other then that they are a great fitting bra that looks great! |||1
Really cute looking bra, but a poor fit for me. I have used Bali underwire bras for years, but I've never had one that didn't fit me well. So I |||1
had to return this one to Amazon. And I have to say that I am so pleased with Amazon, the way they handle returns makes it so very easy for |||1
the customer. Thank you, Amazon! |||1
Well made. A bit small 34B, thinking of returning for larger size...not sure if I want to go through the hassle. |||1
Large breasted women will love this bra! This bra makes me look and feel like I've lost 20 pounds! Good support. Very comfortable. Perfect in warm weather. No shoulder ache |||1
or cutting in. The straps stay in place! An underwire bra that doesn't poke me. Ideal for wearing under button front blouses and retro fashions such as sheath dresses. Highly |||1
Recommended!!! |||1
Sports bras for DD+ are a big load of nonsense. This does everything a sports bra is supposed to do but does it better. Get yourself a non-stretch Granny bra, |||1
get the right size and you're golden. |||1
Other reviewers have said it and I must wholeheartedly agree! The Flower Bali is the best garment that Bali manufacturers, and they've been making them just like this for many, |||1
many years. If you are looking for something to give you a neat appearance under sweaters, t-shirts, dresses -- casual or dressy -- you have got to try the Flower |||1
Bali. |||1
Itchy, pointy, and VERY uncomfortable! How in the heck did this bra get so many good reviews? I think one star is one too many. |||1
This isn't as 'sexy' as some bras, but it looks GREAT under clothes, and is supportive without feeling constrictive. Sometimes when this is sold in outlets, something is 'off' in |||1
the material; it's a little scratchy....but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon, it's l00% right. Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile |||1
bra fabrics. Maybe not so special for 'date night', but for a great bra to wear all week, it's terrific. |||1
I really wanted to like this as an everyday bra but unfortunately while support is good, the shape is quite off, cone shaped cups are rather rigid and leave the |||1
50's bullet impression that is quite unnatural and not flattering on anyone. |||1
This is my second Bali bra. I have both the beige and white. I would buy more if they offered other colors in this style and size because it's the |||1
only bra I've found so far in a 42B that doesn't need "enhancers" to fill the cups. |||1
First, some sizing notes: This bra runs big in the band. I wear a 30F or a 32DD, depending on the brand/style. This bra fits me perfectly on the smallest |||1
hooks. In the long run, that'll make it uncomfortable and big on me, but it's so awesome otherwise, I'm giving it five stars, especially considering the low price.Small band sizes |||1
are hard to find. I'm glad Bali makes some 32 bands. Most American companies do not, and those of us with the unfortunate combo of small band size/large cup size |||1
usually have to purchase very pricey European brands. That's another reason I'm giving this bra five stars. I paid sixteen dollars and change for it. It fits as well (and |||1
is more comfortable) than most of my fancy high end bras. No, it isn't as pretty, but one does need some plain bras!Yes, this bra is truly old school. It's |||1
not stylish enough to be called "retro." Has Bali been making this bra since the early 1960's? It looks like that might be true! Thing is, for those of us |||1
who are big and saggy, this shape can be very flattering. I'm a small gal with a big chest, and old school bras are really great for my shape. No, |||1
I wouldn't wear this under a tight t-shirt, but it's fabulous under any other clothes. I am surprised at how "natural" it looks with clothes on, 'cause it really gives |||1
one old school torpedo shapeOn to the scratchiness that so many are complaining about. Out of the package, this bra feels really fake and almost plastic-y. That sounds awful, doesn't |||1
it? Well, I don't find it scratchy on, and believe me, I am very, very sensitive. I'm always complaining about bras! This one is very comfortable! However, I would venture |||1
to guess that if it was too tight, it wouldn't be. The elastic seems less scratchy to me than many of my other bras, and this weird fabric actually feels |||1
quite good on. Another thing is the straps. Some have complained that they fall down. I am surprised by this, too, as I have very small sloping shoulders and I've |||1
found the straps stay up easily.Gals, get fitted. If you're wearing a bra that doesn't fit properly, you'll be making the straps too tight, and that's when they start falling |||1
down a lot. A bra in the right size is a must. It's hard to find when you are my size, and I wish this bra came in a size |||1
30, but it's so darned close to perfect and such a great price that I'm very happy with it! |||1
This is nothing short of a screaming deal. If you are full figured, you know what a problem it is to find a decently priced, well made, designer bra. Bali |||1
is a name brand in this area, and their bras are excellent quality, and pricey. To get this bra at $7.80, in white, including super saver shipping, is incredible; you |||1
cannnot even match this price at outlet stores. I originally bought three of them about three weeks go, and they just arrived. The sizing is true to other Bali bras |||1
I have purchased. I just put one on, and it is wonderfully comfortable. One particular feature that was not described on the web page, nor in reviews, is the back |||1
closure. It was just what I wanted: four hooks (vertical), in three separate sets (that means there are 12 separate hooks) for providing about one inch play in the width. |||1
Again, this type of closure is difficult to find. The only thing that I would have liked was some elastic on the straps; however, they do adjust in front to |||1
somewhat avoid cutting into the shoulder. As of today, they are still at this ridiculous price, so I ordered three more.Next day note: I wore the bra for over 10 |||1
hours yesterday, and it's the closest thing I've found to not wearing one at all. To address concern in other reviews regarding the shaping, i.e., looking "pointy", yes, there is |||1
a bit of that. For those who prefer form fitting clothing, this could be a problem. This is not a minimizer bra; those will flatten you out if you prefer |||1
that look, but the price you pay is in comfort. At my age, 62, I can tolerate the peaked look because it totally beats the saggy look. I tend to |||1
wear my blouses and sweater tops very loose, so that this issue is not a problem for me. At the very least, this bra is perfect for working in the |||1
garden, when I'm typically wearing an oversized T-shirt. Another note regarding itching...mine do not, and I have pretty sensitive skin. However, a suggestion would be to wash the bra first |||1
before wearing it the first time.May 28, 2014 update: These bras wear and wash well. To keep them in good shape, they are washed in a garment bag with the |||1
hooks clasped to prevent bending. |||1
Have been buying this style for years, never disappointed. Good support at a fair price. |||1
I BUY ANOTHER HAD ONE BEFORE ,I LOVE THESE BRA THE BONES WAS NOT TOO TIGHT. IT FEELS GREAT SUPREME COVERAGE. |||1
Wow...I should have listened to the other reviews. While it looks comfortable-- it isn't. The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I've had |||1
one other bra do that to me in the past, but after some time it worked itself out. I'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at |||1
the hem lines. There for it's being immediately returned. |||1
After trying this on, I'm wondering what bra everyone else got that posted a review. It's comfortable and supportive, but it ran at least a full cup size small. And |||1
the shape - so much torpedo. My chest was so pointy it looked sharp. I'm sending it back before I hurt someone. |||1
First got this bra when my daughter was doing a performance with a lot of jumping around. Her bra wasn't making it, and we looked for one better. Found this, |||1
perfect. Due to the non elastic straps, and the fine support, this bra holds things in place all day long, better than any other bra I have ever owned. My |||1
daughter and I are both well developed. Most bras are challenged when it comes to supporting us, except this one. It is also very comfortable. You know it's on, but |||1
it never hurts. It also puts your chest in a good position, not spread out but forward. Looks very flattering. Truly great support, and pretty. |||1
I wear a 38 DDD and finding a well fitting pretty bra was hard. Found the Bali Flower over 30 years ago and it has been a very good bra |||1
for me. |||1
This has been my favorite bra for Years! Every once in a while I do try a different style but I always go back to this one. The only reason |||1
I didn't give it 5 stars is because the strap on my right shoulder slides off my shoulder so I do have to wear a rubber thing I found in |||1
a bra shop made just for that problem, it kinda bothers my skin, reason I try others. But I've never wornout any of the others before I'm buying another one |||1
of these..... they just work better for me. These I wearout & have to buy new ones. |||1
This fit great. Great support. It fit the bill for a bra to wear with vintage dresses. And my husband approves! |||1
bra is super cheap when it comes to material to have the bali name...supports as well as can be, but would not waste my money on buying this style again. |||1
should be on clearance rack or featured at much lower price |||1
This is an awesome bra. It has a very full coverage old fashioned fitting style but it was perfect for me while I was pregnant. |||1
I have been wearing the Flower Bali for more than 30 years. I Would not even consider wearing another bra. |||1
Good fit and flattering bra. I like that it doesn't have the padded shell as so many bras have today. |||1
Though the cup is a bit large I'm still giving it 4 stars. I'm broad around but have a smaller bust. The overall fit is very good & quite comfortable. |||1
Overall, I'm pleased with my choice. |||1
Since I had a need for one, my bras have always come from a certain popular lingerie chain. Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models, I |||1
really never thought of straying. Problem was, their bras didn't fit me well, and definitely didn't provide me with the shape I desired. Their molded bras made me look saggy |||1
and lumpy, albeit bigger, but certainly not flattering. Plus, I was paying $40 to look this way, so I began to look for other options.Enter the Bali Flower Bra..... excellent |||1
support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape. No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line, but two shapely, lifted and |||1
separated breasts! Best "perk" of this bra, a slimmer looking figure. Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line... can't argue with that!!Now, at that |||1
other bra place, I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option, I opted for a 32B and I'm glad I did. The tighter band is actually |||1
very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect (for once, with a little manipulation, I actually fully fill the cups!).Now, if you're a fan of the rounded molded cups, stretchy |||1
straps and a seamless appearance, this might not be the bra for you. But if you're looking for a classic, slightly more conical look, and solid support, this bra is |||1
perfect. For those who, like me, enjoy wearing vintage clothing, look no further this is the 40s or (less severe) 50s silhouette you are looking for.Finally, the lace. It's pretty, |||1
this is a pretty bra, but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it's a good fit but far too itchy, wash it once |||1
or twice--- you might change your mind.Very happy to find this bra, I certainly will be buying more. |||1
I chose this low rating because this bra is highly structured and not made for comfort. It's not right for me, but others may like and choose this type of |||1
bra. It reminded me of the 1960's. |||1
Purchased for my aunt who declared:it's been a while she got a bra that fitted so perfectlysoft and "barely there" in terms of feeling itdurable |||1
I was doing a lot of reading online. And the bras with the best support are seamed bras. Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me |||1
out.I looked at my local stores but it's very hard to find a seamed bra that isn't a minimizer in huge sizes. Most start in D cups.This is an attractive |||1
bra visually and I would normally just order up one size, but I look like I should be the musical "Grease." Or in a 1950's TV show.My husband said I |||1
was a walking weapon in this thing. I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on |||1
amazon. Anyone who put this on, would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it, and would end up looking |||1
pointy. |||1
Bras's are hard to find in the size that I need and this one came in the perfect size. I am glad I found it on amazon. It gives excellent |||1
support. |||1
I have bought Bali bras before and have not had problems with them. Had under wire bras quite a few times and didn't have problem with them either. Have worn |||1
1 twice and I was at work and I had to cut out the under wire is was so uncomfortable. I will be returning the other 3 that I bought. |||1
If I was smaller they probably would be alright, but being on the heavier side when I sit down there is not enough padding on the bottom of the bra |||1
to protect the mid-section. |||1
I am very pleased with this bra. It gives me a shape and is so comfortable, I forget I'm wearing it. I bought one somewhere else a while back and |||1
was delighted to find them on Amazon so I ordered several more. I just hope they never stop making them! |||1
After literally years of searching for a bra that fits, I finally found it! The Bali Flower fits perfectly. It is comfortable for hours at a time and looks pretty, |||1
too! Thanks, Bali. Now...please don't discontinue it! |||1
I was disappointed when I could no longer find them at my local stores. Thank goodness I found them here. The price was quite reasonable too. |||1
I doubt anyone's body is this shape, or that anyone would rate the fabric as comfortable, it's scratchy!Nothing like the picture... |||1
After becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the uniboob look of my current minimizer bra, I decided to purchase the Bali Flower Underwire. This bra does provide good support, but alas, digressing |||1
from the uniboob to the torpedo look was not my goal when I bought it. I have given the bra three stars for this very reason. |||1
Unlike other bra manufacturers, Bali always fits me. Tried a lot of manufacturers and a lot of sizes but Bali is consistent in sizing for me. |||1
This bra is very comfortable. The fit is exaclty perfect according to the size chart. It holds up well and maintains size and form after many washings. I've bought three |||1
now and plan to buy more. |||1
Being a very busty woman, I'm constantly looking for a bra that will smooth and minimize my proportions. Bali is a trusted name in intimate apparel, so I tried out |||1
this bra. I love the way it feels and how it makes me look when I wear tee shirts and sweaters. It runs true to size, so I didn't need |||1
to return it for a larger size. I recommend this bra to women who have the same problem as I do with finding a bra that will fit and look |||1
good! |||1
I find this bra the first time I wear it is excellent, but then I wash it in the machine in a bag...and it seems to shrink in the cup! |||1
I don't get that at all. I]I'm a 38DD right now and losing weight, so for a cheap bra I can wear till I get down to a 36C this |||1
one will do.As the title says, not the worst, not the best...just ok. And the 38DDD cup is just too big...I tried it. |||1
Comfortable great bra. I'm not one to like wearing bras but this one is nice. I will be ordering it in more colors. |||1
I love the way these cups cover me. I don't care for the cleavage most bras are designed to show these days. Hurray for this simple cover the goods bra |||1
with underwire for support!! |||1
I love this bra! It fits great, and is very comfortable. It definitely is a minimizer bra. I would definitely order this bra again! |||1
Best minimizer |||1
i wear bali bras all the time and i knew that this one would fit like it was suppose too. i have no other comments for this item. |||1
This bra has no padding. It is stiff and a wee bit scratchy until washed with Woolite or similar cold water soap.It is a minimizer. And it works. For those |||1
tops that are tight. This works!MY BALI INDULGENCE 34 DD AND 36 DD. I CAN SLEEP IN. This is not sleeping comfort. This is for minimizing.The price is super. My |||1
other Bali, and Olga bras cost $55.00 to $60.00 dollars. |||1
This bra does provide support & lift, but it is not 'seamless'. This bra is part of the Bali "Classics" collection, so it's been around for a long time.The cup |||1
isn't a stretchy type of fabric, so you can see a little of the cup material through my tops. And, you can see a little of the cup seam (slightly).I |||1
just bought Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra, and that one is seamless- that one is a stretchy type of material. It smooths out over the breast. So, you |||1
won't see the cups through your tops with that one- although that bra fits a bit more snug. |||1
I've bought this brand of bra off and on over the years, but have noticed that the bras that come in white are about 1 1/2" longer in the back. |||1
I don't know why there is this discrepancy but the white bras are perfect. The black bras can be used and fit fine, but you need to purchase a bra |||1
extender to place on the hooks at the back. If it weren't for that, these bras would be in the trash. This is a good bra in that it is |||1
not skimpy, but manufacturer needs to correct the defect in the black bras. I'm hoping they are not making the white bras shorter and only the black bras are are |||1
affected. |||1
This bra fits great, wonderful support plus it looks so pretty, very comfortable would buy again bought usual size perfect. |||1
This bra offers all the support in the world for a full figured woman. It is very comfortable as an all day at work bra. The only reason i"m not |||1
giving it five stars it that it does give a little pointy look to the boobs but not the cone look so its still very flattering. |||1
this is the second round with purchasing these bras. Amazon has the best prices, and easy to find the size needed. Would recommend this product to everyone. |||1
I chose this 5 -star rating because I'm accustomed to this bra, have been wearing this brand for years. Tthe bra fit as it should and was received in the |||1
time specified. I bought three of them this time around and as usual i'm quite satisfied. |||1
This is my all time favorite and over the years I have owned many. Of course they don't last forever . Elastic has not progressed since it was first used |||1
in undergarments. Of course this is what sells more bras? The wide straps can be unsightly if they show |||1
I LOVE THE FIT AND THE LOOK. THE TEXTURE ALSO FEEL VERY NICE TO MY BODY SO I WILL PLACE ANOTHER ORDER REAL SOON. |||1
Its a great minimizer bra, works well on reducing the gap between the buttons. Two problems, it will show through thinner cloths and very low neck blouses. But great for |||1
work shirts! |||1
I usually wear Lilyette Minimizer bras, but now they do not even make the one I really like. So I decided to try the Bali Minimizer, but although it fits, |||1
it does not minimize like the Lilyette does. |||1
Bra fit and has great support but the cups have a very pointy shape which I don't like. The fabric is not the softest and can be very itchy. |||1
I really wanted this to fit and be my go to bra because it holds you up and in so well but the sides are to high on my underarm |||1
and it chafes. if find this to be a problem in some bras so it's not a defect but probably my body vs someone else's. I tried going down a |||1
size but didn't help. |||1
This is a good fitting bra and the brand is a long standing and trusted brand. I would recommend it for its flattering fit. |||1
Had to size up to 38 band as it was too tight. The quality of bra is excellent. The color is a nice neutral. |||1
Purchased this bra for my grandaughter who has extremely large breasts. She was pleased and so was I. Will purchase more! |||1
Since Vanity Fair stopped making my minimizer bra of choice years ago and then Lane Bryant stopped making their minimizer I have had a hard time finding a minimizer bra. |||1
This is the best one I have found. Wish they made all the colors in all sizes!!! |||1
Bali makes such excellent bras. This is very great at minimizing. There could be a tiny more in the lengthening ability of the straps, but really looks and feels great! |||1
I have purchased this bra for years and will keep doing so. Very good quality, fits me very well. There is no digging into shoulders or the wires digging into |||1
you. |||1
ITS A COMFORTABLE BRA AND MADE VERY WELL. I LIKE THE WIDE PADDED STRAPS AND SATIN LIKE MATERIAL. GOOD PRICE. |||1
I love Bali bras. I am very full chested and only Bali seems to fit and support me so comfortably. The minimizer offers a little help with the size of |||1
my breast (so I don't look like I have 2 great pyramids tied to my chest.) The price here was a great bargain and I get the bras I love! |||1
Thank you, Amazon! |||1
Not the bra for large breasted women unless you're planning on pointing torpedoes at Mars! Seriously, what were they thinking when they made this bra. I am a 38DDD and |||1
definitely not happy with this bra. I would say it's more for smaller breasted women who enjoy pointy breasts. |||1
Great fit. This is my favorite style. It is comfortable on the shoulders and fits better than any other bra I have tried. |||1
It fits not too bad, but I did need just another cup size bigger. I thought I ordered triple D and that is what this says, but the bras say |||1
double D. I took the wire out, because it was pressing into my chest to hard, but the bra is comfortable. If I had the right size, I still would |||1
have taken the wire out. |||1
I love the bra, the cup size is perfect. The bra just fits around me too tight even in the last loop. |||1
It does what it is supposed to and is my favorite brand. Make sure to hang it to dry, or it will wear out too quickly! |||1
The bra is strong, sturdy, comfortable, the straps are delightful no pinching or squeezing. The lift is amazing and the 3/4" reduction makes the clothing look and feel much better. |||1
Will be ordering another soon. |||1
I've been wearing a couple of bras that has no underwire and gives great support and is amazingly comfortable. So I'm afraid I've gotten spoiled. This bra fits just fine |||1
but it's going to take getting use to an underwire again. It 's very pretty. and the fit ts true to size. |||1
I'm 56 yrs old. Size 34DD. There are only two bras that I can wear. This is one of them. Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the |||1
price is less expensive than stores (Kohls rarely has my size in stock) and it seems to always be in stock. I hope Bali keeps on making this bra. Within |||1
the last year I did have an issue with a bra (a piece broke) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free.....UPDATE..this has happened twice....the adjustment pieces on |||1
the straps are made of thin plastic. Thin plastic to hold up DDs??????? Cheap. |||1
Sports bras for DD+ are a big load of nonsense. This does everything a sports bra is supposed to do (separation and compression) but does it better. I also wear |||1
the Flower Bali to the gym and tend to prefer that: my breasts have more depth than width and the way minimizers work is to compress the tissue along the |||1
width of you chest instead of holding it out. I think minimizers create a terrible silhouette, but this is an excellent choice for exercise. |||1
First off it fits way too small. I bought it because I was under the influence that it would fit a plus sized woman like me perfectly. Don't be fooled |||1
by that! This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts. It looks nothing like the one in the picture. The under wires are so uncomfortable. I always |||1
buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts. The front of the bra sticks up and out |||1
(the under wire) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top. Getting it on was no picnic. I can usually reach back and snap it shut |||1
but this one refused as it felt too short. I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back. It was horrible and too tight. I tried |||1
to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out (muffin top). Nothing I did worked. All I keep thinking is that there is |||1
a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be |||1
disappointed like I am. The price for this bra is too high. The materiel is horrible and stiff, no softness to it. |||1
Bali bras are the best......especially if you're full figured. Wonderful price. These bras were half price compared to department store prices. |||1
My daughter has a great deal of trouble finding a good fitting bra. This one was fabulous. We will definitely purchase again. |||1
Wonderful love this bra. I have quite a few of these. Bali has been making great bras for me since I was a busty teen.if I were smaller busted I |||1
would still prefer this type of bra. |||1
This underwire bra is the best I've ever worn and one of the longest lasting. I have it in three colors so far. The minimizing effect is an additional bonus. |||1
I understand most minimizer bras give you somewhat of a classic missile t*t look, but this was just weird. Very snug around the waist, the cup towards the torso was |||1
Ok, but there was a very weird "reservoir tip" at the nipple.So sad because I love the color and micro leopard print! It has to go back. |||1
These bras area great! Good quality and fit well. They are not the typical minimizer - this bra does not just squish you and move things to other places. I |||1
have a problem with straps digging into my shoulders. This bra takes all the pressure off my shoulders - no more digging in! They wear forever and the support lasts. |||1
The price is great too. I don't wear any other style. |||1
FULL SUPPORT I HAD ONE BEFORE HAD TO BUY ANOTHER.GREAT BRA GIVES YOUR BUST FULL SUPPORT. MY WHOLE FAMILY WANTS I=ONE LIKE THIS. |||1
This bra is very comfortable and a very good fit. I like the straps and the way the cups fit. It is just about perfect for me. |||1
I found this bra at Macy's for $36. I found a cheaper 36G in another brand in store but only by a few dollars, and it fit like a DD! |||1
This bra fit perfect and I ordered it off here for a grand total of $18 and something, so about half price. It's very comfortable and looks great under shirts! |||1
Love this Bra, this is the only bra that I have complete support. I'm a 36G and people dont know unless I tell them because this bra minimizes and supports |||1
very well. This is the only bra I buy... Just wish they had more colors. |||1
The bra fits a bit tight, was not quite the right size for me. I really like it though, its comfortable and looks good too. |||1
Triple D is too small so I tried G...and still my girls are trying to escape....I hate that. I bought the Goddess plunge in the same size and it fits |||1
great. This is a quality product...just wish sizes were universal |||1
You are gonna love this bra! I bend over they don't fall out! I don't have the uni-boob makes me look slim. My clothes look better! Going to order two |||1
more.LOVE IT HAPPY HAPPY from hot mama. Well I look like it now lol |||1
This is a great bra for support, but after a long day it is not very comfortable. The under-wire should be more padded. |||1
This is a great bra, however, I am sooooo over the minimizer mashed chest look. If you are looking for great support then give this bra a try. Has great |||1
lasting power and does keep you from moving around even during excercise, however, this puppy has moved on from the flattened look. |||1
I wish my favorite bra had this kind of strap. Other than the strap I did not liked the way it fit me. I did wear it for awhile but |||1
not even close to wearing it out before I went back to my favorite....so, waste of money for me.... |||1
this is another good bra I will just continue to keep ordering from amazon for my bras love them. I already got my sister to buy some also. |||1
Great fit |||1
first off i'm 4'9, 34 dd, an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i'm heavy on top, i have the bras that have skinny straps |||1
that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark. this bra is heaven, it fits like the picture.now it doesn't give much lift if that's what you, want |||1
but it supports an don't poke you (wire) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller... yes! and when i wear shirts it don't leave those |||1
lines.i will buy more!!! |||1
soft, attractive, and I will purchase again. |||1
it fits a little tight and i am not sure if it will fit better once it stretches a little |||1
This was the very first bra I've ever owned where I did not have that extra row of boobs. Very comfortable and form fitting and non-cutting. Sometimes bras that are |||1
for larger breasts cut along the sides, but not this one. Money well spent. |||1
This is a great product for a great price. I have been wearing this style for years, but have never had such a great bargain. I couldn't believe the fast |||1
service! |||1
I've worn this bra for years and ordered my usual size--38 DDD. Like many others who wrote reviews, it was way too small. I had to size up to get |||1
the fit I had before with the smaller size.Overall, I find the bra comfortable and it provides great support. Just size up. |||1
I like this bra. But it does squeeze me on the sides. The boning digs into my skin. I think this will be alleviated after a few washings. |||1
I have been wearing this brand of Minimizer bra for over 15 years and I won't buy anything else. The fit is great and it lasts. I wash mine by |||1
hand and hang to dry and it fits fit like it just came out of the package. It does a good job of minimizing and this helps with finding tops |||1
that fit better. Not only does this bra have great support, it is very comfortable. |||1
38DDD. I wasted way too many years buying Lilyette. Lilyette quality has diminished dramatically over the past year and I was concerned about finding an alternative. I tried the Bali |||1
Satin Tracings Minimizer and was pleasantly surprised. The Bali is rather comfortable. Washes well. Life-span is average. You'll know when to buy new when you feel the fit change.It is |||1
also a 10X better minimizer than any other bra I've tried. In fact, I used to need apparel tape to keep the front of my blouses from gapping. With the |||1
Bali, my clothes fit perfectly without needing that bothersome tape. Hopefully, they will make this bra forever and leave it just the way it is...don't change the fabric, don't change |||1
anything to make it "new and improved". |||1
I think I will like it better once its washed several times and stretches just a little. I have had these before and found the same thing. If they offered |||1
half sizes, I would have gotten a half size larger. I know the next size up does not fit...its too big, BUT this is a nice bra, does a good |||1
job of minimizing. It does go up a little into my arm pits, but I don't think that will bother me after it softens up a bit. Like the straps |||1
and shape of cups. Well made. I would love to find a bra that I give 5 starts to but probably will not in my lifetime. |||1
I've worn Bali for years and usually wear the snowflake style. This time I ordered this bra and I like it even better. The fit couldn't be better and it |||1
is so comfortable. |||1
I have been wearing this particular style for many years, and was happy to find a great deal on Amazon. Much better and more dependable than other internet sources I |||1
have tried, and so convenient to use. This bra covers quite a lot and is very comfortable to wear. |||1
I love AMAZON. My sister in law is an AMAZOn lover too thanks to the beautiful Bali bras I purchased for her. She loved the fit, quality, and the great |||1
value I got. |||1
Bought this for my girlfriend who is pregnant and she said that this bra is supporting her heavy boobs and need to get more. I going to surprise her with |||1
a few more, wish it comes in more colour. |||1
The fit on this bra was not right for me. So I returned it. The straps are awfully short and can't let them out enough. |||1
This is the only minimizer bra I have found that supports me well. I tried another,more expensive brand at one time, but came back to the Bali. I discovered with |||1
the other bra, my breasts were always sagging and spilling over. I wear a 34DDD. If I don't have a good bra my back suffers, not to mention the fit |||1
of the clothes. The Bali provides both. |||1
I love Bali products so you can't go wrong with Bali. This is my 4th. I don't feel the wire hence it's very comfortable and also minimizes |||1
I have purchased this bra at Kohl's before. Great support and well made.This is a great deal and arrives very quickly! I am Very Happy! |||1
The bra fits true to size however is VERY STIFF and a bit uncomfortable. It also has a unrealistically old fashioned style that makes it unflattering to look at. Keeping |||1
it because it great for minimizing but not the prettiest under garment in the bunch |||1
These are the only nightgowns I have. They fit well, pack well, wash and dry well. They are comfortable to wear in all seasons. I just bought several more and |||1
the robe to go with them. |||1
For the person who is hoping for a dark blue or dark green gown, I have the dark blue gown, it was the very first one I bought about 10 |||1
years ago and also I have the dark green. Those are two of my favorites and since it is an old color, they are not likely to be reissued. I |||1
just thought I would let you know. Sorry. |||1
Lovely fit, stayed on my shoulders, soft cool material and went through the washer-dryer without a problem. What is not to like about this night gown? The length is perfect |||1
for me, although I'm 5'8" and it comes a bit below my knees. The flowers are very feminine. Choose purple and save some money! |||1
I liked the gown, very pretty, however, I was purchasing for my Mother and she wanted the long gown.. So I returned and found the long gown elsewhere. She was |||1
very pleased. |||1
Buy to gift to my grandmother. She love it, and want to wear everyday!! Perfect to use in home really comfy. |||1
This night gown is very pretty and very comfortable. I will order more in many different colors. The detail on the yoke is very nice. |||1
This gown is an absolutely beautiful gown that feels like a million dollars. I purchased it in this deep purple color as a gift and I can't wait to give |||1
it. |||1
Comfort and fit is great. |||1
I must say that I do love Shadowline products which are so very comfortable and fun to wear to bed. |||1
The sapphire color was the only option in my size 1X. Not crazy about the color in person. The fabric and construction is good quality. Neckline is a little higher |||1
than I expected (compared to Vanity Fair or Miss Elaine). |||1
This is a beautiful nightgown. The fabric is a nice weight, and not at all see-through. I usually order nightgowns one size larger, so I have room to move when |||1
I sleep, but this nightgown is very roomy. I had ordered one size larger than normal, but had to return the gown, and get my normal size. |||1
Like the gown very muchLike the quality of the materialFits nicely and comfortableWill purchase this brand again |||1
I like this gown. I admit it looked a little old-ladyish when i ordered it but it's really quite cute. It's modest enough if you have to pick up the |||1
paper in the driveway. |||1
I have several Shadowline nightgowns, but this is the first one I have seen in black. With the pretty red rose embroidery, I knew I just had to have it. |||1
It is very pretty, washes well and is quite comfortable. |||1
The perfect quality of Shadowline tricot is tops in the business. There is no other that compares. I'm replacing 20 year old Shadowline gowns just because after 20 years they're |||1
a bit discolored - that's it - the fabric stays as perfect 20 years later as it was day one. Excellent product & here an excellent price. |||1
I have worn these gowns for close to 20 years. I like how they are made without any itchy lace or scratchy seams, how they make rolling around in bed |||1
easy, and that the fabric is a better quality than any other nylon nightgown I ever owned. I also like the "flutter" sleeve especially now that my upper arms are |||1
not what they used to be, it is nice to have them covered but not constricted by a traditional sleeve.I knew that the Shadowline brand had been sold in recent |||1
years, so I was a little concerned about the quality having changed. I just bought 2 in the magenta color since it was new (for me anyway) and was delighted |||1
to find that the quality remains. I have always gone for the darker colors since they seem to afford just a little more modesty than the pastels. |||1
I have loved these gowns for years - they never disappointment me. They hold up extremely well. I will purchase this brand many more times. |||1
I bought this and the matching robe in pink as a gift.Recipient (my mom) said it's too sheer for her and is essentially see-through. That might be ok (frankly, it |||1
wouldn't bother me - sounds nice and comfortable), but it's not for her.If you are questioning among the reviews whether it really is too sheer, I can say that at |||1
least in the pink and at least for my mom, it is. |||1
My mother in law wanted a new night gown and she likes the light weight one's. She really like this one.She said it is comfortable and fits her well. She |||1
is very small and petite and the length was good for her. |||1
This is an awesome gown. Have been wearing these for years. The gown is not flimsy nylon but a high quality material. You can't go wrong. |||1
This Shadowline Nightgown is very well made, and very comfortable to wear. The fit is perfect and the softness of the material makes for a wonderful experience. This nightgown is |||1
perfect for lounging and sleeping as it is as luxurious as it is comfortable. Oh, the price was excellent for the quality of the nightgown! I definitely recommend them and |||1
will purchase them again in the future! |||1
It's difficult to put the bra on once you have these on the straps. Either I maneuver myself into the bra after attaching this, or I just get my husband |||1
to do it for me. Both ways are annoying, but hey they get the job done. No falling straps! |||1
This is an excellent product that will keep bra straps perfectly aligned and prevents slippage. They are very comfortable and work well with any bra. |||1
I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up. Many years ago, I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and |||1
is being discontinued. I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place. It works perfect. |||1
I wish I didn't have the extra bump across my back but it's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps. I like that it is |||1
adjustable, too. |||1
This works and stays in place. I wear Soma allura bras and body by VS and I'm bigger busted. It's pretty comfortable for what it is but I am shopping |||1
around for a bra that won't need this. |||1
... but I am not an acrobat. Takes me more time to try to get it on than it's worth, at least, in my opinion. |||1
This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product! Because the plastic is so slippery, when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to |||1
adjust it to your liking, as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders, the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of |||1
where you begin when you tried to adjust it. I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast, but Im a size 8 and a |||1
B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is. Furthermore, the company I bought this from here on Amazon (i.e. Lady Grace) has an outrageous shipping cost! This |||1
piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed |||1
catalog (along with this cheap gadget) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it. Total waste :-( |||1
I've always had a problem with my bra straps slipping off my shoulders. This has solved that problem. The only thing that you need to do is make sure your |||1
bra is hooked and step into it pulling it up from the bottom. Once up the straps will straighten out. It's so nice not having to spend the day pulling |||1
up my bra straps. |||1
At first, I could "feel" them on my back, but after a little while, as I wore them, I not only forgot about them, but I forgot about the bra |||1
straps that I used to pull back up on my shoulders every few minutes. |||1
We received these shoes as a gift, and I'm actually ordering a larger size for my daughter now. I love these shoes! They're so adorable, and we constantly receive compliments |||1
on how cute they are. My daughter has been "standing" since she was about a month old, and she's actually started to wear out the bottoms from pushing herself along |||1
when she's in her walker. Even so, I'm really quite pleased with the construction and materials. They're very easy to slip on wiggly feet, too. These have become my go-to |||1
gift for expectant moms with a baby girl on the way. |||1
Too damn cute! I love these shoes! Now, the only problem is we're not so sure yet when my sister's baby is going to be able to wear this. It's |||1
too cute!!! If they're having a girl, I'm getting her a pink one. :) |||1
I loved these shoes as soon as I saw them. My son hasn't been able to wear them yet (I purposely bought them bigger), but I can't to show them |||1
off! |||1
great product, very stylish for baby, i made a mistake on choose the rigth size, when the shoes arrive to my home my babu has growing up and the shoes |||1
cant fit on them. |||1
These shoes are very cute. I can't wait to see my friends baby in them (right now she is still a bit too small for the shoes). The shoes also |||1
came in a nice box with a clear cover to display them. |||1
I have ordered pairs of these infant converse for both my son and my daughter when they were infants. I got so many compliments on them when I took the |||1
babies out wearing these shoes. They really made an outfit seem so stylish.The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby. The soles are soft |||1
material, as well. I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking, otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles |||1
is white canvas type material that really shows dirt. I have thrown them in the washing machine but they don't get all of the stains out from walking and can |||1
look really dirty, which detracts from the look of the shoe. So, I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage. |||1
I also don't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker. If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting |||1
the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much, and which grip the ground well. You can find them here CONVERSE Kids' All Star Core Ox TodI |||1
also feel that these shoes run a bit small so I recommend going the next size up, which will also help you get more use out of them. All in |||1
all, they are adorable shoes and the height of baby fashion, and they are comfortable as well. Get a pair and get ready for lots of compliments when your baby |||1
wears them! |||1
I bought these for my grandson who isn't here yet but can't to see them on him. They look just like the adult shoes. |||1
Cool Converses for my little one. We needed a size or two up from the 1 she outgrew. I love the stylish versatile kicks. Goes with practically half her wardrobe. |||1
I ordered these for my son that is due in Septmeber. Since Daddy always wears Chuck Taylors I wanted them to match. They are just adorable and I can't wait |||1
to see what they look like on him. We are using them as a prompt in our maternity shoot which will be fun :D |||1
Shipping was a little slow compared to how things usually come. But shoes are perfect for my baby girl and I can't wait til her foot is big enough yo |||1
wear them! |||1
These are the cutest things ever. My baby takes off her shoes constantly, and these are great because they lace up and she can't get them off. They run slightly |||1
big, which is good too. I love them. |||1
I bought this brand and Danskin tights to see if there would be a difference in quality (I haven't been big on Hanes, as a brand, before), rather than stock |||1
up on a bunch of colors in one brand.I'm glad I did it this way, as I won't buy these again. They ended up getting a run the very first |||1
night I wore them, then they just tore into a hole.For starters, I didn't even like the way they felt. They didn't stretch well (I have big hips and bought |||1
the size supposedly appropriate for me, according to the chart), and they were too snug around my upper thighs, of all places. It's like they designed it for children's legs.. |||1
very runway model, ignoring that women's thighs are typically bigger than their calves.And they were SO THIN, I might as well have shaved and wore nothing. I bought white because |||1
I was hoping to get some white sheer like the picture, but it was nothing like that. So don't expect these to hide any hair/blemishes you have on your legs, |||1
or even look like you're wearing white tights.The only reason I can think of that this gets two stars rather than one is the price and I'm pretty sure they |||1
arrived when expected. |||1
No stretch at all. Are like nylons from the forties. Give me elephant leg or flat out fell down. I threw them away. |||1
These pantyhose provide terrific tummy support and do a lot to highlight my legs. The "reflections" look great as I walk. |||1
I thought the further up the size alphabet the larger they get I was wrong they also need to put the proper size chart along with the product. |||1
I keep coming back to this product. Hanes feels very nice and silky on your legs and they look good as well. I would recommend. |||1
Just got these and I love them. True size, good quality and they really do their job with the "control top" thingy. I would buy them again. |||1
I have had so many Hanes pantyhoses in c/d size, but this is not c/d for sure. It was too small and short. Very off size and false advertisement. Unless |||1
Amazon is selling defected or off sizes of this brand/style. |||1
These tights are extremely soft and very flattering. They fit perfectly and looked very sleek and of high quality. The only thing is, I purchased the barely there color and |||1
it is a little darker than the picture. In fact, it is more of a tan color and would go perfectly with people who have a tan complexion like I |||1
do. You really can't tell I'm wearing tights until you come closer and even then, it is such a nice, sophisticated look. These tights would go great with formal evening |||1
wear and dresses. |||1
I have been wearing Hanes Silk Reflections for over 15 years now and I still love the sheer look and silky feel of them on my legs. I have many |||1
pairs of Hanes Pantyhose for daily wear in different colors as well as Silk Reflections Thigh Highs and Stockings. I have tried other brands but always come back to Hanes |||1
Silk Reflections. I have tried other brands of pantyhose that are as sheer but not as durable, I have found some that are as durable but not as sheer, Hanes |||1
has it all for me. The fit is perfect they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles even after a long day.I am an Amazon Prime member |||1
and that has been wonderful the shipping is always fast and on time. Whenever I can find my Hanes hose with Amazon Prime available I purchase them. It is so |||1
much easier to buy these online and have them delivered at no cost I am so happy with my Amazon Prime membership. |||1
my legs are mostly in no nonsense pantyhose but a co worker said to try the hanes sheer nylon pantyhose, i really like how sheer my control top sheer toe |||1
silk reflections pantyhose are, these pantyhose are very soft and sheer nylons, like all of my pantyhose when i pull up very sheer pantyhose i take my time so i |||1
dont run my nylons and pantyhose, once on i love how these pantyhose make me feel, i prefer reinforced toe pantyhose but sheer toes are nice also. i wear pantyhose |||1
and nylons everyday and now have several pairs of hanes pantyhose. |||1
Very sheer, which is good, but the Cafe Au Lait color has more tan to it than I expected. Overall, still a good purchase and I will buy more in |||1
other colors in the future. |||1
I always feel hose of any kind not quite as long as I would like. I am 5'7" and weight 129 yet they always seem to be "not quite" as |||1
long as I would like for an easier fit. |||1
Not only do these hose fit, but they really do exert control comfortably. They are also strong (have used for years) but have a silky quality. Cannot speak highly enough |||1
about this purchase. |||1
they last pretty long and the color and length are fine. I actually have been able to wear each pair more than once. |||1
they are a little darker than nude, but they are exactly what I expected. comfy panty hose, hopefully they last |||1
this style does not say if it is Sandalfoot or reinforced toe...couldn't buy because of that |||1
My wife is 5'4 and finding these in many brands was easy but that is not the case anymore and this is easy again. |||1
The stockings are great. The color itself isn't really "barely there," though. It's more of a sheer dark tan versus a natural color. Just fyi. I'll order another color to |||1
get what I'm actually looking for. |||1
In one day I got a run and had to get a new pair, exact same problem. Won't be buying these again. |||1
I've tried a lot of expensive pantyhose and these hose compare with the best of them .They look and feel fantastic and fit like a dream, feels like my legs |||1
are dipped in nylon...very luxurious and sexy.These pantyhose say more than feminine, these pantyhose say female. .. |||1
Had not thought about buying hose online but this great! Using prime it was free shipping! I don't live around any stores that sell hanes and it would be a |||1
75 minute drive to find them! Thanks Amazon! ....oh and the hose! Hanes Silk Reflections are very very sheer and are a great step in-between tights and tan legs! |||1
These are good hose with a generous fit. Pearly white color was perfect for me. I am tall 5'11" and they still fit me just fine. |||1
Hanes needs some better quality control these days. The color I ordered, "barely there," is a very dark color. It is supposed to be so light and transparent that anyone |||1
can wear it and appear to have bare legs. Overall, Hanes is a good product and fits well, but it's a hassel to bother with returning things when they don't |||1
catch color problems like this. |||1
I got these nylons for a party in winter. The "Jet" color is a nice light black, not opaque like tights but definitely noticeable. I prefer nylons that have some |||1
color so it's clear I intend for my legs to be an unnatural color, and not just strangely tan or bandage-pale.I'm 5'5" and 125lb, and the size A/B fit perfectly. |||1
They were comfortable all night. |||1
I have been buying Silky Reflection pantyhose for over 20 years! I love the soft feel on my skin. They fit just as the package fittings recommend. |||1
Normally I'm a bit leary of combination sizes, but these fit great and the quality of these panty hose is excellent! |||1
I bought these pantyhose based on another customers review and I was not disappointed! They are quite lovely on and the control top does the "tucking" I need it to |||1
do! Put my heels on and felt so pretty! |||1
Nice standard pant hose by a good company, has a nice shade, would be nicer if they were cheaper but will work. |||1
Have been using the same size and color for years and really like this style. Amazon is the only place to consistently get this product since my local market always |||1
runs out of them. |||1
These fit way too small, in my opinion, and they are not heavy enough. I like my hose to be a bit thicker. |||1
she does like these but she has worn out a few pairs. so for the price they are good but higher price last way longer so in the end may |||1
be a better buy in reality. that said, we were satisfied with the value. |||1
i didnt like how the size chart is not accuratestockings are well made however nothing specialprice is decent |||1
nice material pattern and design, can wear it under things or alone, good for work , dress or lounging. washes well, great color |||1
I've been needing a nude shade and this one seemed to fit the bill. However it is really thin and will probably run immediately. Also I'm not too sure about |||1
the color for my skin tone. |||1
Had they not got a run as I was putting them on I might give it a higher rating... Was bummed. |||1
I bought these in a hurry so I didn't research the size. If you are a big-hip beauty, I do not recommend. They fit fine until I had to get |||1
them past my hips. I gave it five stars because after all the wiggling and pulling, not one run appeared. |||1
I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose. I have been wearing them for over 15 years, I have tried others but keep coming back to Hanes. I love the feel and |||1
looks of them they fit me perfectly and still look good after a long day. They feel wonderful on my legs and feel great under my clothes whether I am |||1
wearing slacks or a skirt. They are also very durable for such a sheer pair of pantyhose.As an Amazon Prime member I used the 2 day free shipping and received |||1
the package on time and in good shape. |||1
i love my hanes pantyhose, they fit and feel great on my legs, i wear no nonsense pantyhose and hanes pantyhose to work everyday and these pantyhose are another one |||1
of my favorite nylons, ive had a few runs in my pantyhose from time to time but all my pantyhose have had runs in them. these pantyhose are wonderful to |||1
put on and make my nylons look sexy. i also wear silkies pantyhose nylon stockings, leggs pantyhose and other nylon pantyhose. i wear pantyhose everyday in high heels and usually |||1
my nylon feet are in sheer reinforced toe pantyhose. but i have lots of sheer toe pantyhose and nylons. |||1
This classic hosery is still one of the best out there. It looked great all day, and the color is no natural. |||1
Hanes always gets it right - size, comfort, good make and quality. These are true to size and feel great, smoothing out the contours of the legs. |||1
I bought these for my Mother who is short with heavy thighs. The fit was a little small and she found that getting them over her thighs comfortably was difficult. |||1
These hold up and are a great value. They are also very pretty and flatter my not-the-best legs. I don't like wearing pantyhose but in a professional job they are |||1
still needed. That's my opinion, anyway. I have some great dresses and suits with skirts for work (yes, I am the consummate professional) and these are a necessary accessory. Is |||1
'necessary accessory' an oxymoron?Thanks, Hanes. You make me thinner and more impressive. How many products can honestly boast that?Marcianne Waters |||1
I went ahead and purchased it, thinking i'd be getting tanned color. For some reason, i have this way of thinking buff= dark/tan color... Turns out it was not even |||1
close. I normally wear barely there, and this one was very creamy. Although this isnt something i would wear on a normal basis, it did go really well with my |||1
black skirt w/ white feathery sweater top. I wouldn't dare wearing it with any other though, just not my color; Too bright. It was a nice try though. |||1
I don't like control top. if you're already wearing a skirt or tuck in your shirt or have something around your waist, this control top deal makes you feels like |||1
you are being squeezed to death. it's just too tight and uncomfortable and really it pushes in some places. |||1
Sizing was fine, but they have a 'texture' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and weren't very comfortable to wear. |||1
Got this for my wedding, im darker in colour but just because im wearing white all through, i want everything to compliment.. Nice Hose. |||1
I love this panty hose. It's so sheer and silky and looks so luxurious. If this rating is lacking in words and not enough then I am sorry that's all |||1
I got to say. I get to the point |||1
These pantyhose are really terrific! The legs are very silky to the touch and the control top lets you shed a couple of those unwanted pounds without a diet ! |||1
I think a color labeled "Barely There" should be much more neutral. I realize that if I had a dark tan or were of a different ethnicity perhaps these hose |||1
would look "barely there" on my legs. But as it is they remind me of the nylons I wore in junior high, colored "Cinnamon." In fact I may send them |||1
back, I'm so disappointed. The shades depicted online are not at all representative. Cannot speak to fit or durability as I haven't tried them on yet. |||1
Great job from Hanes. As promised, this pantyhose is silky but well-made. Hanes is quickly becoming my go-to brand for beautiful stockings. Needless to say, I highly recommend Hanes for |||1
all your hosiery needs! |||1
Hanes offers the best quality panty hose on the market compared to similar products. The hose is durable which I like most, nothing worse than for them to rip or |||1
run right out of the package. Wash and wear and it still goes strong compared to others. Consider me a fan of Hanes products!! |||1
Fit, slick, good feel. I did get a runner though at the wedding. When will there be a hose product that doesn't run yet look sleek? |||1
Ok ladies, pantyhose, in general, are getting difficult to find anymore. Many women hate them. But, for those of us that don't have a problem with them, it seems as |||1
though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from, and no more 'pantyhose'. Let alone NAVY. This is the real deal. I plan on buying more for my 'stash'. |||1
These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year. You get |||1
what you pay for, and these are a bargain for the quality. Love them! Thanks for carrying, Amazon. Now, I can save gas money from running all over the place |||1
looking for navy hose. |||1
Very light weight in texture I sent them back. Still waiting for credit. I thought for the weight they were too expensive. I was looking for more warmth in this |||1
product |||1
These tights are high quality and have held up wear through many wears and washes. The fit was as expected. |||1
Good price and shipping nice color goes with most outfits heavy enough on colder days great size comfortable Thanks a lot |||1
These are soft on the skin, they fit and they don't sag or bag (i.e. comfortable). I think these are a great value. I also got a pair of smart |||1
wool tights - and I'm finding these almost as warm but MUCH more durable and economical. I've bought more. |||1
I go through a lot of tights and these ones have lasted the longest! They fit great and the color I got (lagoon) is awesome! I get a lot of |||1
compliments on the color. I have a dog and she likes to jump on me so I get a lot of runs in my tights and I have to throw |||1
them out! These tights have stood up to my dog's claws numerous times and they still look good! |||1
I have purchased opaque tights at local department stores and they did not fit orprovide the opaque look I wanted. These are perfect in every way.Highly recommend! |||1
It is so hard to find a demi bra in 38DDD first of all. Second this fits amazing!! It is cute and so comfortable! The bottom does roll under a |||1
bit but not bad just if I am lounging on the couch and up and down alot. I am not sure how well its going to hold up over time |||1
(I don't think it's going to be more than a year) but totally worth the $$$$$ !!!!!! |||1
I am a true 32DD and this bra is very beautiful and true to size! It is delicate, while still being supportive. Great buy! |||1
I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays |||1
flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not |||1
hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays. |||1
I found the band to be a little bit snug, but it otherwise fits pretty much as expected. However, don't be fooled by the picture for this item. Unless you |||1
have naturally perky breasts or you would actually wear a half size and size down, your breasts are not going to sit that high in the cup. As with all |||1
demi bras, beware: any upper chest side boob fat you may have will be smushed into adorable little rolle, in a most unfortunate and highly visible manner. Don't buy this |||1
bra if you are carrying 20lbs extra or more. You will not be happy with the results. |||1
A little stiffer than I would have liked. But because the waist does run slightly smaller it fit a bit snug in the underbust and under the arms. I am |||1
sure that also the stiffness contributed to that. But if you order a size up on the waist size and are looking for something sexy and not something to wear |||1
for support all day it is a super cute and sexy bra... |||1
The Whole thig was Huge I normally wear a size 38DDD so I figured I'd be fine with a 40DDD but the straps were huge! Even with them tightened all |||1
the way it's like they expected my boobs to be a lot closer to my belly button then my shoulders. I had to cut 5 inches off the straps and |||1
re-sew them to get it wearable and even then the fabric was so worthless that it did absolutely nothing other than make me not naked. |||1
This bra is pretty, and I do love the "bounce" that a good balconette bra gives, but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately, resulting in me constantly |||1
pulling up fallen-down straps all day.I wouldn't recommend this bra is you're a large-breasted woman. |||1
This bra fit nothing like the Wacoal and Natori 32DDD bras I purchased from Nordstrom. I won't say it was too large, or too small because that wouldn't be accurate. |||1
It just wasn't *right*.... |||1
Finding a 32D in a retail store is impossible. Ordered online and the cup fit is a little off. The underwire is a little small and the cup itself is |||1
a little large. I guess I'm just the wrong shape. The 32C underwire seemed to fit the same and the cup was a little small. So I guess I'm inbetween. |||1
In the interest of helping others...I'm 5'6" and 134 lbs (yeah, I know...working on it!). I'm a true 32DD in most brands. My ribcage actually measures at 31.5".First things first: |||1
this bra is beautiful, sexy, not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down (THANKS AMAZON!!!). I purchased it in the black and |||1
its lovely. It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined. The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and doesn't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top. |||1
The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler. The |||1
straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls' without cutting into my shoulders. The back has three hooks. The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small. |||1
I LOVE that the underwire doesn't come up too high. It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides. For some reason, where the underwire meets in the front |||1
REALLY pinches. I really want this bra to work so I'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO. Fingers crossed!UPDATE:Ordered the 34D. |||1
THe band was more comfortable (perhaps slightly loose?) but the cups gapped on the top. I must be fuller on the bottom. It made the girls point down and out. |||1
Very sad, indeed. Sending it back. It is beautiful...though. Maybe for someone else with a different shape. |||1
I have 40dd breasts and it so hard to find a pretty bra that looks sexy, but still holds the girls in.This is perfect as it is a mixture of |||1
balconette and demi so you get some cleavage without everything falling out like most of the plunge bras.. I went back and bought in it ivory as well! I a |||1
hooked. |||1
Fits as expected, with a nice thick band. |||1
Felina products fit very well and are very confortable to wear for the whole day. Do watch for new styles to come out from them. |||1
Online this Bra looks Delicious! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable. The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little |||1
too much for Poor Old "Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra."They, I, didn't feel comfortable, nor safe walking or playing around in it. I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies, cause |||1
HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady!YOu dig? |||1
If only they had them in my size! I am a 34 G, but decided to try the 34 DDD since they don't make this bra in my size. It |||1
is just incredibly beautiful- but, alas, it was too small, and I didn't want to have to go to a 36 inch band in order to make the DDD work |||1
for me. |||1
I love this bra! It is comfortable and fits very well. I plan to order more. It arrived much sooner than promised. |||1
I got this in both the black and the ivory, and I love them both. When I first went to wear them, they were a little scratchy in the beginning, |||1
but they became more comfortable and now are my favorite sexy bras. The part I enjoy most is the straps with the ribbon detailing... if the straps peek out, they |||1
look so pretty! |||1
So if you are among the overly blessed like myself (34DDD) then you will find that most pretty bras are just not for you. I like this one and even |||1
though I ordered the correct size I found myself sort of spilling out of the top ever so often, and really really spilling if I bent over at all. Just |||1
becareful maybe order a cup size larger for this particular design? |||1
This bra fits, looks sexy, feels good and was just an all round wonderful find and good purchase. Get one if you can. |||1
I love this bra so much. It doesn't give a strange shape to my chest like some unlined bras with underwire do. It's super comfortable and fit perfectly. I got |||1
it in City Rose, and it's more of a bright pink but I still love it. Planning on getting more in different colors. |||1
I love the color and the fit its kinda itchy but after you wash it a few times its perfect |||1
Not to sheer can wear under semi sheer tees without anything showing nice color against skin just the right amount of uplift would order again! |||1
This is cute but it's scratchy in all the places you don't want it to be scratchy like the band and the straps. The straps have nude felt-like material for |||1
additional durability but I think this is what is part of the problem because the material used is cheap. Anyways, don't buy this one--go to the department store and find |||1
another cute one. |||1
seller shipped it pretty fast & i was pleased to get this brassiere. it perked up my asset nicely. in fact, i bought another pair for me for a great |||1
price. i wished the alabaster color was on sale & had my size. unfortunately, it was out of stock. hopefully, i'll get it for a great price (again) in the |||1
future. |||1
As a sissy it's so important to feel feminine when cross dressing. My breast inserts fit quite nicely into the cup. I love the pink color which is my favorite |||1
color!!! I love prancing around and feeling dainty in this bra!!! |||1
I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too |||1
close on the sides. The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, |||1
being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND |||1
the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide! It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center! No thanks! Plus, it pushed really hard into my |||1
sternum! The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful. |||1
I bought this to match a pair of panties to make a sexy set, not for comfort. Boy was I surprised when this bra made it's way into my "comfy |||1
bra" drawer. I think I'll end up with four more of these. They made your girls look great, you feel sexy and it is surprisingly comfortable. |||1
Fit perfect and it was a good price for the size. It's hard to find bras the exact size I need so I was pleased when this bra fit as |||1
expected... |||1
The bra is very nice and good value for money. It fits perfectly, is very comfortable and rather sexy. But I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for those who |||1
like more relaxed style of life. |||1
This bra is amazing, it's supportive and super comfortable. I'm a 36DDD (sometimes a 34) and this fits like a dream. Also, it looks fantastic on, I will be ordering |||1
in more colors!! |||1
Nice looking bra. Super sexy, not itchy, boobs look amazing! I will be ordering more because it is so hard to find sexy bras in the larger sizes |||1
I love these bras. I've bought them in all different colors. The only thing that I can complain about is the fact that the underwire tears through the fabric. I've |||1
had to sew all of them. They're thin and comfortable. I'm quite busty with a small rib cage and it's hard for me to find bras that fit but these |||1
are my favorite. |||1
I was surprised by the high quality and great fit of this bra for a really affordable price. Lots of detailing not really shown in the photo. |||1
So, why am I happy with this? It is a 36 B, and I pretty much fill it out. As others have mentioned, sheer bras are normally way too large |||1
in the cup, usually because they're stretchy. This is not stretchy through the cup, and I couldn't be happier. I'm built lanky: long arms and legs, broad shoulders, small boobs. |||1
This does not dig into me, and I don't find it to be itchy. This is working for me. I am so freaking glad it doesn't push my breasts together!!! |||1
All that does is make them look smaller, and, well....squished together. How that is supposed to help, I have no idea. Who ever thought that up? This allows them to |||1
sit a lot closer to where they want to sit (they tend to point outwards just a bit), however, it DOES GIVE SUPPORT. This is a small miracle. Hats off |||1
to Felina. And, thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments clued me in as to how this would fit! |||1
Unfortunately, I ordered the incorrect (too large) size, so I really can't speak to it. I am not saying anything negative; the wrong size was my error. I returned the |||1
bra. If there were a way to choose NO STARS, that is what I would do. |||1
This fits wonderfully and is very flattering, definitely a great deal! I will be ordering more soon, hopefully in different colors! |||1
Felina makes some really great underwires, central gores, and band structures. Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will |||1
perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the |||1
ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set |||1
breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to |||1
expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires |||1
fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This |||1
particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and |||1
conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail |||1
is. Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me. |||1
The fit is terrible. The narrow straps cut into my shoulders, but if they are loosened, the cups don't provide the proper amount of support. You must be the exact |||1
right size to wear this bra...comfortably. |||1
but i liked it. it makes her chest looklike one of those marie antoinette women. we had to exchange for a larger size though. |||1
Great usual Felina fit no surprises here. Has a nude colored lining under the lace, looks very nice. Good support, too. |||1
this bra is very supportive, and finally I feel sexy in it. it fits like a balconette, however keeps the girls up and in place |||1
The bra looks lovely on. The strap design gives the effect of skin peeking through, & the shape it gives is surprisingly natural, I.e., more of a sloping, projected look |||1
as opposed to very round & boosted up. So that's either a plus or minus depending on your preference. But the straps are very thin & fairly rough on the |||1
sides; I found they cut in after more than a couple hours of wear. |||1
This is a good looking bra. When Felina state it is for a full bust I get one cup size smaller than I would on other bras. I recommend this |||1
product. |||1
This bra runs suuuuuper small. Make sure you order up a cup and bands size. If I had gotten a proper size, I may have had a better review :( |||1
The Bra looks exactly as photgraphed. However, I was expecting a soft feel instead the fabric is very rough around the the underwire and even the cups. the straps are |||1
lined so they were ok. Couldn't wear this for more than a few hours. I donated it to Good Will |||1
Couldn't find this brand in my size in the Mall where I live. I was first introduced to this brand years ago at a large department store. Glad I found |||1
some Felina styles here. Fits well, though the straps could be a bit wider for the larger sizes. |||1
34dd lilac bra. Super pretty and feminine. I want to get all the other colors now. And yes it fits just fine. |||1
I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it! I just ordered another one. I would highly recommend this bra. It is very sexy, and |||1
comfortable.Update:After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable. I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I |||1
kept goes in the "Not form fitting, and comfortable" draw. I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts. I |||1
will be ordering another pair! |||1
These bras look as beautiful as they look in the picture shown. However, they are cut a bit shorter at the top. Although not padded, because of having strategically positioned |||1
seems one can wear them under T shirts and thin sweaters and not worry about revealing too much. |||1
This stunning bra is every girl's dream bra. It has the right perks for any bra to have, from being comfortable to the adjustability. It can match the likes of |||1
the Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Brasas this bra is like nothing else. |||1
This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive. I'm large-busted (anywhere between a 32DDD and H, depending on brand/maker) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups |||1
run small on most brands that aren't specifically for large chests, and this item doesn't come larger than DDD. It turns out to be a little large in the cup, |||1
which almost never happens to me! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage. I'll be returning for a smaller size. |||1
I did not like the seam placement in the cups....it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though. |||1
What a beautiful color and the fit is great. I love to have a wide selection of color in my undies and this bra is beautiful. The quality is excellent |||1
and the price was great. I wear a 34DDD and am glad AMAZON carries all the things I desire. |||1
I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long. I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose. I've probably only |||1
had that problem with 1% of all the bras I've ever bought, and sadly this was one of them. The cups run generously sized (which for me, as a D/DD |||1
usually is a positive thing, but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down). The overall design was cute, but the |||1
odd sizing made it a no-go. |||1
As soon as I put this bra on I never wanted to take it off! I wear a 36DD and its hard to find a bra that makes me feel |||1
this hot & sexy and still be supportive and comfortable!! I want it in every color now!! Love love love!!! |||1
This bra is really pretty and holds the big puppies firmly in place.Great quality and looks very sexy. I will be buying again |||1
There are many kind of bra out there, such as the Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Bras; but then there is this item from Felina Women. This bra has both |||1
style and fabrics going for it. You will disappointed from this item. I assure you. |||1
Their bras just fit me. I love how they look, I love how they fit. No gapping, bunching, and no popover up top :) |||1
This is the second time I purchased a bra on Amazon and the sizing is not the same as the bra in store. I got fitted for Felina bras and |||1
was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras. When I tried the bra on in store, it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the |||1
store price was way more expensive. This bra has so much space in the bust area that I cannot possibly wear it as the 'girls' will jiggle with any step |||1
that I make. Terrible! |||1
one of my clients always finds it hard to find the right bra ... so this was a good find the material she says is a bit thin ... so |||1
it doesn't offer much support .. bare that in mind !!! |||1
These fit very nicely with no annoying side seams. I really like the cotton better for daily wear. These are very good with some outfits that cotton doesn't work well |||1
with. |||1
These are comfortable, wash and dry like a breeze and move with you. Comfortable under slacks no matter how tight. |||1
I have been wearing these for years and really like the brand and fit. I used to buy them on-line from Hanes, but then I discovered they were available from |||1
Amazon cheaper. This time however I needed to purchase them individually, rather than getting a cheaper price by ordering 6. I would like Amazon to bring back that option. |||1
Like wearing a piece of silk with a little elastic throughout for support. No snags of binding against the skin and slack, etc. slide on and stay in place. These |||1
also have a cotton crotch to allow health there. I had 6 and just bout 4 more of these panties. |||1
I L-O-V-E (LOVE) these briefs. I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet. They |||1
are comfortable. They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit (I wish more often). They also wash |||1
and wear very easily and simply. I can even throw them in the dryer. What's not to love? :) |||1
Bali Skimp Scamp Briefs are THE MOST COMFORTABLE UNDERWEAR I have ever worn in my 64 YRS. of life!! They are very Soft and Silky with a back seam instead |||1
of side seams. These briefs NEVER, EVER Ride up or get stuck (you know where), they ALWAYS Stay in Place, my clothes glide over them very easily and there's No |||1
visible Panty line either!! I would rather go without than wear any other under garment!! Try 'em, You'll LOVE 'em too!! You'll Never be Sorry with this purchase. |||1
I wasn't so sure about order these panties online, but it worked great. They are the same as I've seen in the store except I thought I was buying cotton |||1
instead of nylon. Nevertheless, they work just fine. |||1
These briefs have been my favorite briefs for over 25 years now. I am very long waisted and rather curvy and these are the ONLY briefs that I found that |||1
DO NOT RIDE UP!...I hope Bali never stops making them. |||1
I have worn these for years and love them. They fit and feel great and hold up very well. I highly recommend them. |||1
I like the panties ,because they do not ride up they stay put where they suppose to be....love them...thanks,I will buy them again.. |||1
As my title indicates these fit very well, are comfortable and pretty. They seem to hold up well in the wash, although I usually take mine out and air dry |||1
to help the fabric and elastic last longer.I have bought more and will do so again. |||1
I bought my first pair at a department store...then went to Amazon and bought 3 more pairs...liked them so well that I bought 3 more! I love the fit!! |||1
I wore one pair once and gave them away because I didn't like the way they felt. The fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow. |||1
These Skimp Skamp Briefs are the most comfortable undies I've ever worn, and I've been buying them for a long, long time. They're perfect for anyone who doesn't like bikini |||1
or high-rise panties. After three babies, I can't wear those things anymore. The fabric moves with you, and they're practically invisible under clothing. I add Oxi-Clean to the detergent when |||1
I wash them, as chlorine bleach does a number on them. Plus I use a hanger with clips to air-dry them on the shower rod, as they last longer that |||1
way. |||1
I bought a large number of these panties throughout the years....always the best fit and quality. I wear no other brand or style. |||1
I have owned Bali skimp skamp panties for years because they fit nice and with proper care last a long time.The Apple Blossom color is nice, I love it. |||1
I probably missed the explanation for the "seam" up the middle of the back side on this brief. Just a little too "clingy" for me, thanks.However...for those of the younger |||1
set the clingy-fanny thing might just blow your skirt up.Was in a hurry when I ordered these and might not have read the details. |||1
Wonderful fit and thay are so smooth and soft, Love Bali panties and would and probably will order more in the future, Well made and lasting, |||1
Size 5 is not always easy to find, so I will keep them even though I'd like a little snugger fit. The quality is very good. |||1
I was looking for panties that fit well, with comfortable coverage and that didn't show under pants or jeans. Skimp Skamps are all that! I've worn them in the past |||1
and started buying another brand for some reason I can't remember, but they never fit well or washed well. I'm so glad I have found Skimp Skamps again. I'm sticking |||1
with them this time. Great price for a great product! |||1
These are pretty but I'm not going to wear them every day. Not what I expected but nice. A little to sheer . |||1
Bali Skimp Skamp briefs are the ultimate in comfort. I recently purchase a pair to give them a try and I am know hooked. I wore them on a long |||1
airplane ride and never a tug or pull, no riding up. Wonderful. Give them a try. |||1
What a find! This brief has one seam going up the back. Other than that it is seamlessly smooth and comfortable with just enough stretch to make it so. Pretty |||1
much the perfect pantie. |||1
Fits like a sack, styled like something my mother might have worn - very late in life. Not nice at all. I DON'T wear tiny underwear, but there's enough fabric |||1
in these for two pair, going on three. Yuck. |||1
I like how smooth these are but I ordered them too large to help slim me, but still wear them as they are very comfortable and wash well. |||1
These are the best. When you get them out of the bag, you might think you ordered panties that were 2 or 3 sizes too small, but that's just the |||1
way they look until you try them on. They fit great. They hold in your stomach quite a bit and the leg opening doesn't ride up in the back. Stays |||1
put. These also come in a lace waist band that rests lower (on your hip). I have that style too and it is nice but I like these better. |||1
If you've never worn stretch panties. Skimp Skamp definitely takes some getting used to! That said, they seem to be of very good quality. |||1
These are very comfortable and pretty, too. I like them a lot better than I expected to! If you are considering them - go for it. |||1
Sizing runs a bit small, unlike the hi-cut version with thin waistband that I just love. The lavender like violet color is very nice. Wish it was availiable in the |||1
hi-cut, slightly sheerer version. The leg elastic was a bit tight at first, but loosened up after a couple of wear/wash cycles. I like nylon briefs the best, as long |||1
as they have a cotton crotch. Will order more in the next size up when these wear out. |||1
I probably made this mistake and bought this item too big, but I think I could fit 3 other people with me in this thing. I normally wear a size |||1
6-8 dress, but the size 8 underwear are enormous! Shapewear always seems to run weird, and I have bought items too small in the past, but this is not shapewear, |||1
just huge black underwear. |||1
I now have over 40 pair of these fantastic womens panties. I have found after wearing and washing these for several years, that they always fit the same, and are |||1
very comfortable. The lower gusset seam helps keep a males equipment in place. They will also stretch in the front to accomodate mens excitement. The rear has a soft seam |||1
that keeps them were they belong. The more they are washed, the softer the feel. Move over ladies, these are meant for men also. |||1
It is nice that skimp skamp briefs are now in lacy or flowery patterns. I have been wearing skimp skamps for years and love them since they don't ride up |||1
at the back. |||1
Nice to see more colors. Wife loves this brand and style. no ride up or down they stay in place. we hope they will make the High leg in more |||1
colors |||1
Looks nice, Feels good but a little high waisted. Other then that I like them on. Yes, I do recomend them. |||1
Unlike some other women's briefs made by Jockey, they are designed in the traditional style - no thick waistband here, and it's even covered in cotton to make it soft |||1
and comfortable. Brief does come up high on leg but still backside of panty stays in place. Cotton is soft and breathable. |||1
Jockey is the BEST. the have larger sizer and aren't afraid to sell them.Large woman need cotton comfort and Jockey gives me that. |||1
great product from jockey. very comfy and good fit. would get these again without a doubt. no regrets this time! |||1
I was relieved to find that Amazon offered these jockey briefs. This was the first time I had to buy them online. For me it is easier to shop online, |||1
but I tried the local stores and they no longer stock this size. I will have to start my shopping with Amazon in the future. |||1
I've gotten this brand several times for a gift and the recipient always loves them. She said they fit so comfortably,don't shrink, and don't ride up where she doesn't want |||1
them to if you catch my drift. |||1
the only underwear that I own, These panties never bind nor ride up--and they are thin enough to wear under smooth clothing |||1
Excellent product. Give me a discount or a rebate and I'll write more about this product. I'm Jack Benny's cousin.Jesus is Lord. |||1
I like the quality and fit. I would recommend and plan to purchase more if they have more pastel colors. |||1
I have been wearing Jockey Elance bikini's for over 25 years. I decided to buy some of the briefs after an abdominal surgery to avoid the scar being irritated. The |||1
Elance briefs were very nice. As always, these wash up well and can last for several years without a hitch. I trust the Jockey name and as I mentioned, have |||1
worn their Elance products for over 25 years. Not disappointed at all. I highly recommend these. |||1
Jockey makes the best underpants ever. The fit me perfectly. Soft cotton and the waistband is soft covered cotton also. |||1
Well sewn, comfortable, really good fit, great fabric, waist and leg openings are very comfortable and stay where they belong without binding. |||1
I find this brand extremely comfortable & durable. As I've lost weight over the past couple of years, these have been great. |||1
As my title indicates these fit very well, are comfortable and pretty. They seem to hold up well in the wash, although I usually take mine out and air dry |||1
to help the fabric and elastic last longer. |||1
As expected cotton briefs. |||1
It's just okay for me. Yes, it's cotton. But, this for me almost covered my all stomach. Not like the picture, until the hole of the belly. It's really weird |||1
because of that. Maybe because i'm petite person, but have big bottom. |||1
I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating. These Jockey briefs are good quality, but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8. I first ordered |||1
3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s. There is at least 2 or more inches |||1
difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter. I can't complain about the quality of Jockey, but sizing is a totally |||1
separate issue. The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP. |||1
I buy jockey and was looking for a cheaper three-pack. I couldn't find what I wanted so chose these. One had polka dots and the waist is too high. I |||1
don't want the man in life to see me in these. Ugh. The quality is okay. |||1
I have ordered this product before and have been very happy. They fit well and are comfortable and last a long time. Happy with this purchase |||1
I have bought this style in the past so I knew they would fit. So I bought more in size 9. They are comfortable but seem to run a little |||1
small. But not so small that they are uncomfortable or that I want to buy a bigger size. Just more snug. My previous purchase said they were made in Costa |||1
Rica and these say Honduras. I don't know how that makes a difference, but these are definitely a little tighter.Even so, I prefer them to most other underwear and I |||1
really like the comfortable waistband. They do shrink a little in the wash, but I find they really hold up in general. I took these underwear (my previous purchase) abroad |||1
for 6 months where I had to hand wash them and hang them in the sun... this will destroy clothes pretty quick. But these held up great.Jockey isn't what it |||1
used to be... the material feels thiner now. But I still prefer them over other underwear for comfort. |||1
They aren't exciting, but they're comfortable and practical. The cotton is soft and a bit heavier than the cheap underwear you get at Target or similar store. The whites ones |||1
are just a teeny smidge smaller than the pastels of the same size. I don't know why that would be, but it is. They feel supportive (even though there's no |||1
spandex) and minimize jiggles. Good quality underwear for a decent price. |||1
They fit great. Needed all cotton with covered elastic, and this is what I go. Good value at a good price. |||1
These are the most comfortable and best fit I've found anywhere. I'm glad I got them, will get more, and definitely recommend them. |||1
Fit is perfect to size. Waist and leg openings are very comfortable and covered in quality cotton. These panties never ride up or down, they stay put. Long lasting and |||1
perfect fit. The quality surpasses your average panty. Will absolutely keep purchasing. |||1
It seems that jockey is using a different sizing agent these days, but it wreaks of patchouli. Before opening outside box, make sure to run water in your washer. That |||1
way when you open the interior box you can quickly put the underwear in the washing machine. My heavens, if you have allergies to scents and smells you have BEEN |||1
WARNED. |||1
How can a package of 3 pairs of panties have 3 different fits? One was perfect, one was a tiny bit small and the other seemed just a little off |||1
center somehow. Jockey has been my brand for a long time and I'll keep buying them, but I'll know that the fit is not consistent from pair to pair. |||1
These undies are well-made and very comfortable. The leg elastic is covered with fabric. The best panties I have ever worn! |||1
I found these to be huge, far bigger than a size 6. I have ordered in the past from jockey and found I liked their products and so ordered another |||1
style in a smaller size to try once more. I hope these fit and are not so old fashioned. |||1
These are just what you would expect. Nice quality and the size is correct. If you want good cotton old lady panties these are what you need. :) |||1
The fit is good. The elastic around the waist is very snug, though. I am a small woman and I like high-waisted panties for a smooth line under skirts and |||1
dresses. These cut in just enough (waist size = 25 inches) that I don't get a nice smooth line, so I keep these for under pajamas or sweats or lounge-y |||1
clothes--stuff where a smooth silhouette doesn't matter. |||1
I am glad that I read the reviews. The briefs came and the fit perfectly-very comfortable and I would purchases this style and brand again. |||1
i love the variety of colors they come in; they fit great and there is minimal shrinkage; definitely will keep buying. |||1
I really like Jockey underwear, and I can count on the size being what I need. Jockey underwear's quality has somewhat declined since the time I first bought them decades |||1
ago, but the quality is still better than ALOT of other brands. They are all cotton, very comfortable, and last a fair amount of time-not as long as they did |||1
originally, but again, better than other brands. |||1
I used to wear the Jockey for Her cotton briefs. They fit perfectly and lasted for years. Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I |||1
had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs. I was happy to find Jockey underwear on |||1
Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of |||1
the Elance briefs.Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package! I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all. When I got them out of the |||1
package the leg holes looked like they were too large and I think that is the problem. They are definitely not "full coverage" and I do not want part of |||1
my bum uncovered. At least the cotton knit is nice and soft.Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a |||1
year or so ago. They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do. I will say that the Elance pants are not the worst underpants I have. |||1
I bought a package of Hanes a while ago and they are much worse!After receiving these underpants I did further research and found that what is described as "PLUS size |||1
Classic briefs" actually are available in the size 6 that I wear.......and that is not a "PLUS" size by any means. If the description had not specified PLUS size I |||1
would have looked at those and ordered them and perhaps been more satisfied. However, I am very hesitant to order any more Jockey underpants because of the problem with the |||1
leg openings being too large in the Elance style. |||1
These worked well for their intended purpose; which was wearing after abdominal surgery. My normal underpants hit in the middle of my long horrible line of staples. I ordered these |||1
a couple of sizes too big and was much more comfortable. Also (TMI here, sorry!) the blood and serous drainage washed out nicely. These really did hold up well to |||1
laundering. |||1
The quality is good. The fabric is soft, and this is a very very nice cut.Definitely will buy them again.bought this from amazon at a way better price than a |||1
retail store. |||1
I ordered these Jockey underpants after talking with a friend, who really likes these undies. I ride horses and have issues with rubs from the saddle with almost any other |||1
underpants I have tried. This brand fixed my rub problem. I like the covered elastic legs and the high leg cut design. What I did not like is the fact |||1
that one color (dark gray) shrank two sizes when I first washed it. The other colors did not shrink (white and heather gray). The company says shrinkage is about 10%, |||1
but my experience is that shrinkage is more, particularly from top to bottom, rather than shrinking around. Jockey has also offered to let me return the pair that shrank excessively. |||1
I thought by ordering Jockey I would avoid the generally poor quality of underwear that seems to be in the marketplace these days. Jockey is no better than the rest. |||1
The individual panties are not cut the same despite being marked the same size in a 3 pack, and they run small to size and do not provide correct coverage |||1
as a French cut. |||1
These are the panties that serve the everyday with durablabilty , breathability and comfort! I will get another 6 and have them because everything I like ends up being discontinued! |||1
I have been buying these undies for YEARS and my Mom buys them for me too. Super comfortable and long lasting!!! I like the color variations as well.. |||1
After trying Hanes underwear, I immediately returned to the one and only Jockey French Cut. I have been wearing this brand and style of underwear for nearly 25 years, as |||1
my body has gone through all shapes and sizes -- and they are the best. They are cut for a full size rear end, which I have always had and |||1
still do! Non-binding, comfortable, fit well. I love these underwear. |||1
Apparently, Jockey makes different styles of underwear for sale in stores and online in packages. I got what I thought looked identical to ones I got at JCPenney--every detail was |||1
the same, the fiber contents were the same--and when I got them, they were not the same. They do fit pretty well--but not as well as the others I have. |||1
They are not soft and silky and stretchy like the ones I got at the store. They are really thick, and so a little hot for summer and they don't |||1
have a lot of stretch. |||1
These seem to be oddly cut. The upside is they can be washed in very hot water and dried and I'm not afraid of damaging or shrinking them. |||1
I've worn this underwear for years and gave up finding more (should have thought of Amazon earlier) The fit is perfect for me, high enough they don't slide off my |||1
hips, low enough they don't slide up the cheeks of my fanny, leg cut large enough to not cut off the circulation in my legs, more? oh yeah, they're all |||1
cotton |||1
This underwear is made with great quality material. The fit is perfect, no problems with this product. Would recommend over Victoria Secrets any day. |||1
These are the only underwear I'll wear. They are always comfortable, last forever and wash and wear great. They don't leave a panty line and never roll, or move up |||1
your butt. I highly recommend especially for plus size women. |||1
The best feature of these panties are the cotton covered waist and leg openings. This makes them much more comfortable than the straight elastic |||1
I love Jockeys Women's Underware. These underware fit well, and definitely last. They are comfortable, and will be buying more. |||1
Even ordered some of these for my mother in law and she loved them too. I think they are a little over priced but the quality is good. |||1
I have been wearing the Jockey French Cut undies for more than 20 years. I have tried other brands, but Jockey makes the best, longest-lasting. Very comfortable. |||1
I have worn these kind for awhile now. They fit good, feel good and not a bad price. What is there not to love. White cotton is my favorite, however, |||1
the colored ones are just as nice. Very comfortable. Love Jockey! |||1
The quality of the item is fine but there are 2 different sizes in one package of three. How can you reorder with that kind of inconsistency? No way would |||1
I recommend this to anyone. |||1
I love simple white underwear. Easy to wash, easy to bleach to get that nice clean look. Cotton is breathable and comfortable. This design has the nice french cut, which |||1
means they go higher up on your thigh. I buy a new 3 pack about once a quarter. I use the more worn pairs when I go on vacation or |||1
on a business trip, and then just throw them away instead of having to come home and wash them...:)These are not the most longest lasting underwear ever, but I sure |||1
like them right out of the package. Which is important. If you have to wash them for weeks before you like them, what a waste!Nothing fancy or sexy about these, |||1
but they are quality and comfortable. |||1
I may be an "in-between size" these days. So it's my fault if they seem a bit small; but the next size up is too large. Have worn these for |||1
years; love the cut and feel and wear. These are my favorite. Arrived on time; and packaged well. |||1
I was waiting to have a bad odor from these panties because other people's reviews spoke about a fragrance. I didn't detect a bad odor and they were exactly what |||1
I ordered |||1
I have worn these for years, but was concerned about recent reviews reporting an odor. They do have a smell, like you might have from your detergent. It is not |||1
strong enough to concern me, but I would just as soon it not be there. I have washed them once before wearing and will see what happens as I do |||1
more washings. The fit is as usual and I like the colors and pattern. |||1
Horrible smell gave me an asthmatic attack when they arrived. Unfortunately I bought 15 jockey underwear so they are going in the trash. Waste of a lot of money! Shame |||1
on you Jockey! I have allergies and asthma and only buy unscented products. There should be a warning label on these toxic underwear. Do NOT buy! |||1
These are really verging on "granny panties", and I am by no means a skimpy underwear person. I like a good basic bikini but these are so big. I will |||1
keep them, because the quality is good. |||1
Have been wearing these for years, but was hesitant to purchase a new pack after reading reviews from folks who noticed a never ending smell. Thankfully, I was one of |||1
the lucky ones. Purchased two packs and had no problems. |||1
The Jockey Elance Bikini is closer to a low-waisted brief than what I think of when I hear the word "bikini". The leg openings are low and the back has |||1
full coverage. I think they're a nice compromise between a brief and a skimpy bikini.These panties are cool, comfortable, and long-wearing. They hold up well to machine washing. I should |||1
note the Elance line runs large on me. You may need to order one size smaller than you would for other brands. |||1
Fit. Comfortable. Prime. Who could ask for more? It would only be nicer if more patterns were Prime. I had to buy three sets of these to get Prime and |||1
now I have a lot of blue in my drawer. |||1
100% cotton, fit well, don't look to dowdy, I will buy more! These are good quality and cannot seem to find them anywhere except on line. |||1
These fit better than any panties I've ever worn. The price on Amazon is lower than any department store and the shipping was free. I'm very happy with this product |||1
as is my daughter. We've been fans of Jockey panties for many years. |||1
I have been a jockey fan for many years but the last package was poorly constructed, very thin and has started to unravel already. I would switch to hanes all |||1
cotton; the waistband is thinner and the fabric is less sheer. |||1
There aren't many options for inexpensive cotton bikinis that let you pick the color range you want. So I decided to take a chance on these despite some of the |||1
complaints about the smell, since some of those reviews were older. These bikinis did arrive with a very strong baby powder smell. I couldn't stand to wear them until they |||1
had been washed 6-7 times. However, after repeated washings, the scent is nearly gone. Now they are very practical and comfortable. |||1
I've been wearing these for over 15 years and love them! They are cool, comfortable, cute and sexy at the same time AND they last a long time. Although I'm |||1
a size 4, I have a "full caboose" and these accommodate that very well. One of the other things I just can't stand is when the bottom rides up (like |||1
those boy shorts)in the rear and these don't do that with me. |||1
Love the weight of the cotton and the smoothness. Tried to see if they fit when they arrived and they did albeit they were a bit baggy in the buttocks.Thought |||1
maybe they would shrink a tiny bit and be perfect after laundering. Cold water, delicate wash cycle with organic soap and then inside line dry. I'm still kind of shocked |||1
that they shrank so much.I would need to order a size larger than normal to get perfect fit. |||1
I found these to be a bit smaller than store brands like Hanes and Fruit of the Loom. I do like the style though. My one big problem with these |||1
panties is that they are perfumed. Seriously, whose idea was it to scent women's underwear?? Why is this necessary? Jockey, do you also scent men's underwear, or are women just |||1
particularly stinky? And why would they think we would like it?? I've washed them 3 times now, soaked them overnight in a borax and vinegar mixture, and they still smell. |||1
I'm worried that I could get a UTI from the scent if I wear them. As long as they keep using perfume in their underwear, I will not purchase Jockey |||1
panties again. |||1
My 11-year old daughter is 5' 2" and weighs 103 lbs. She's straight as a board and doesn't have much of a butt. However, these size 4 fit her very |||1
well. I was concerned, since I ordered online and couldn't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them. She really likes the prints and when |||1
she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom. That's good, since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight. They're Jockey, so |||1
they're made of great quality! |||1
These are my go-to undies for everyday wear. A friend suggested them years ago and I've worn them ever since. They stay put without the sticky bands that some other |||1
brands use. Comfy, flattering. |||1
Great fit, just as I had hoped. Good quality, feel very sexy on. My partner likes them too, loves the look and feel. |||1
These shrank something fierce after a couple of washes in warm/hot water. The legs just became too tight to wear. |||1
These comfortable all-cotton panties don't ride up or chafe, and they fit well. I will be ordering them again soon. |||1
I wanted to go to all cotton underwear as part of a move to more natural products. Bought these in size 4 (my pants size) to try them. I was |||1
unsure what size to buy. I have washed them, and they shrunk a little i think, but not much. They fit very well, do not ride up, and are very |||1
comfortable. As for the reviewer who thought they come up too high and show over her pants, I suggest her pants are waaaay too low :-). if these show, she |||1
may have bought them too big, or her pants are so low, she is at risk of exposing her doo da! I am here to buy more today.Update: Liked so |||1
much, I bought 2 more packages. I bought a size 5 in black and a 4 in white. Don't see much difference. Jockey sends a coupon with the first order. |||1
Coupon code is BBFTTYYSH. Try it for 20% off. May have to order on Jockey website, but can pay on Amazon site. |||1
BOUGHT FOR MY WIFE. SHE SAYS SHE LIKES THEM . ALSO SAYS THAT THE FIT IS VERY GOOD AND SHE WOULD LIKE ME TO ORDER HER SOME MORE... |||1
I am a bigger hipped person and find that I have a hard time finding cuter, sexier underwear that fit right. These work perfect. |||1
When I bought these panties, I really wanted to like them, but I couldn't get any further with them than opening the package. They have a "perfumed" smell. I really |||1
don't want any fragrance on my underwear. |||1
These are perfect for a 58 year old woman like me who doesn't want to wear granny panties. Fabric and cut are great. |||1
I really like these. They are very comfortable, no matter what I'm doing (sleeping, exercising, sitting around). And they last a long time. They were my favorite underwear colors to, |||1
especially the dark grey. I wish they were still available. |||1
As always, a good, sturdy product. You can wash these many times, and they last a long time. I'll always buy from Jockey. |||1
Love these. First time purchasing, fit well and comfortably. They seem well made much better than multipack undies from a box store. Flattering and wash and dry well. Pefect everyday |||1
functional underwear. |||1
I know I need to lose a few pounds, but I did order a size up. Maybe I will like them better once I get back on my diet! The |||1
colors were really good. Bright pink/fuscia, bright royal blue, and one floral pattern. If I like them better after the weight loss, will update the review. |||1
Comfortable, basic and just what I needed. Completely lacks annoying frills,lace and other irritating materials. Cool, breathable cotton. Wears and washeswell. Highly recommended! |||1
I can't find these in stores anymore but I'm used to them, so its nice to know I can get them online. |||1
I have bought Jockey before and they were quite good but these seem already stretched to the max Before putting them on , very little give left in the bands |||1
.I don't know if it's a cheap knock off with a bogus Jockey label or if Jockey is now cutting corners but I wouldn't buy them sight unseen again .Probably |||1
back to brick & mortar for Jockey purchases ( see what it is Before I get it ) . |||1
I need 100% cotton panties, but finding something low rise that did not show above my pants has proven nearly impossible. I have tried Hanes and other Jockey bikinis, and |||1
found them NOT low rise even when they claimed to be. Elance in the black color has been the lowest rise of all and works ok for both jeans and |||1
working out. They are not as sexy as I had hoped for, but at this point, I'll take what ever I can get. They are comfortable, true to size and |||1
of good quality.This was originally a 4 star review. And the BLACK color I ordered still is, see above. However, I also ordered the pink/ivory/peach color combination because I loved |||1
the black so much. I was disappointed. I ordered the same size, and the package and tags say bikini, but they do not fit like the same pantie. They are |||1
baggy and the rise is much higher than the black, by 1.5 inches (AFTER washing in hot water and drying on high temp). These are not low rise as the |||1
description and box claim. These panties show above my MID rise jeans (when standing, I do not have to sit for them to show), and I don't mean they "peak". |||1
At least 3/4 of an inch shows in the back. In my opinion, these fit like high cut briefs, not low rise bikinis. I have tried so many styles to |||1
try to find LOW rise, 100% cotton underwear. I thought I had found something close enough to work in the black. This other color just doesn't cut it for me, |||1
and I am now hesitant to order more of the black. Will they fit like the first set I bought? Or will it be more wasted money? I will keep |||1
this order to wear while working out. They won't show under my karate uniform, but I have yet again wasted money one something that does not live up to its |||1
description or my expectations. I don't think expecting consistency between colors is too much to ask. I mean come on, a 1.5 inch difference in the rise?UPDATE: I have since |||1
ordered a package of white and a package of gray shades. The package of white was, again, larger and higher in the rise, not as bad as before, only about |||1
0.5 inch difference, but enough that the fabric bunched and wrinkled because the fit was too large. The gray shades were perfect fit per the size chart, just like the |||1
black. Both sold and shipped by Jockey. Don't know why the lighter colors would be larger, but I'm going to stick with ordering the darker colors. |||1
I love these. The fit is great and you need to make sure you get your size. The fit is pretty accurate so it's not a time to order too |||1
big or small to get the best fit. These also don't ride up on you like some and they wear very well after several washes as well. |||1
These are a very comfortable product. I can hardly tell when I have them on, and the design is great for avoiding pantylines. The fabric is breathable, but not so |||1
thin that it will lose it's shape or support. They wash well. It's always hard to find packages of JUST black panties, so I was very excited to see Jockey |||1
offered this at a reasonable cost. Highly recommend! |||1
I love Jockey underwear because they fit great, are cotton, string and don't ride up if you are slender like me.Comfortable and black is great! |||1
I just ordered more! I bought some at Kohls and loved them. I am tired of lacey underwear falling apart. When I found these on amazon, I ordered more and |||1
was just as pleased. They have full coverage and a little bit of style. If you are wondering about sizing, they are slightly more generous than Victoria secret's sizing. I |||1
wouldn't say 1 whole size larger, but maybe 1/2 a size larger. |||1
Love the fit of these underwear, you will not regret, perfect fit and fast and easy transaction. Hope this helps and good luck..... |||1
These bikinis are comfortable and attractive. The best of both worlds for me. I'll definitely be ordering more in the future. |||1
I have been using this string bikini for over 30 years....then, department stores stopped carrying them because they "don't sell as well". Now, I found them online and I am |||1
back wearing them. They are ALL cotton-therefore breathable and comfortable besides looking good on you as they are nicely-styled (read "sexy", the picture with model's tummy facing the right does |||1
them more justice). My dermatologist recommends all-cotton panties. And these are that and look great..NO granny panties! The cotton-encased elasting band is VERY comfortable, keeps its elasticity even when the |||1
product wears out finally and protects skins afflicted with latex intolerance (my problem) or allergy. The bikni over all is sturdy and lasts and lasts. I highly recommend them. I |||1
thank Jockey for still making them. |||1
These fit very nice and all 100% cotton. Got a lil string up front for the string bikini and it could pass as men's underwear. Got plenty of room up |||1
front for my twigs and berries (average size). Best cotton panties I had so far. |||1
This bikini underwear fits so nice and does not ride up. It is very comfortable and I will order more. |||1
I haven't been able to buy undies that fit for over a decade. With the 'fattening' of America, new clothes are cut larger. Pant legs swim on me, yet they |||1
fit at the waist. These undies fit at the waist and in the buttocks but like all of them I buy, the leg openings are too large & with these, |||1
the leg opening elastic is too stretchy. That makes them ride up. I have now bought approximately a dozen different brands & styles. I am going to keep at it |||1
until I find ones that fit 'teenage' legs. I have an APPLE SHAPE BODY, meaning same size legs & butt I had in my 20's, but all the weight I've |||1
gained over the years going to my middle. Ugh! That's why I still wear bikini undies. They fit below the belly fat role. But I still need to cover privates. |||1
These do not work on my body type. I suspect they'd be great on pear shape beautiful women. So far the ONLY undies I've found that fit (some work when |||1
you put them on but stretch out during the day), are 'Barely There Women's Flex To Fit Bikini Panty' (you may want to buy one size larger than your size |||1
if you are on the upper side of your size). I hope this helps others. Extra note, I loved the fabric & feel on my body. If the elastic had |||1
been tighter, I'd have kept them. |||1
I'm most definitely the size that I ordered and have been for many many years. The cup size fits great but the straps and back clasp don't seem to be |||1
sturdy enough to add support or keep from shifting around. This has now become my laundry day bra, unfortunately. |||1
I could go on and on about this bra all day long. So so so so so comfortable and makes my boobs look just delicious. This bra has a way |||1
of pushing up your boobs and making them look larger without having a bunch of overstuffed padding that makes you feel like you're wearing some sort of costume. I will |||1
for sure be replacing the rest of my bras with more of these. I'm actually a little pissed I went so long not having this in my life. |||1
I usually buy my bras in the store so I can try them on. I lucked out with this one. I wear is everyday. |||1
Nice bra, not very soft tough and its a little bit smaller than I thought. I wouldn't buy it again but it does look ok. |||1
I've already reviewed this bra in the lace, and it's the same exact bra. A dream to wear. I own like 6 of this same bra. Love this brand. |||1
OK, this is my new favorite bra! It's soft and comfy like a t-shirt bra, but with underwire and a little push up. Underwire doesn't pinch or cut at all. |||1
Perfect. It gives a little oomph without you feeling like you're going to fall out if you bend over. |||1
i got so excited because i thought they finally made a bra my size , but no, this thing had B cups and the gils were spilling all out and |||1
squished at the bottom, It was a boobie trap! |||1
Buyer Beware I did not try on per say just held it up to my breast that I just recently had surgery, They run small and will not take them |||1
back. |||1
This has to be my new favorite bra! It is so comfortable. Great support and I am a 38G! You will not be able to wear this with a low |||1
cut shirt but it will look great under tshirts and sweaters. |||1
It's not lined so you definitely might have 2 peaks showing through your shirt. The cup wasn't the right fit for me. I've been experimenting with finding the appropriate bra |||1
sizes and decided to try a 30F in this bra because a 30 E wasn't available. My true bra size is a 28E and my sister sizes are a 30DD |||1
and a 26F. I thought if I went in the middle and got a 30E it would fit but I was wrong. Definitely get your true size in this bra |||1
if they have it, If they don't, then I wouldn't recommend getting a sister size or guessing which size would fit. |||1
I've been having trouble finding a bra that fits me properly. I did order two different sizes in one order, so that I would be able to know which one |||1
fit better. Glad I did. NIce bra at a decent price. |||1
I have the t-shirt bra in n this same brand and love it, but this one although supportive, just not attractive. I'm a 30G and I know I can't expect |||1
to wear those lacy cute bras the smaller girls get to wear, but I would like somewhat attractive. I'm not ready to look like a granny just yet. |||1
great bra, runs big in the cups....I am small in the back, but, this, the cups not for me anywayHad to return mine, even though I did try it on |||1
in a hurry, purchased the bra, and had to return both...I am a 36 DD, very nice, cups run big. I am a 36 DD in all bras, this one, |||1
not to good.....Fav bras, Bali new "comfort bra" awesome, Bali "t back bra", Gap," full coverage lace", and my very fav. "Champion everday bra", wonderful, perfect fitting in each styleSo |||1
beware.... |||1
I wanted a black bra that would still provide lift but made it possible to wear button downs. This bra fits the bill. I will say that it does not |||1
look as good with looser (re: no delineation of form), sleeveless tops that have a high neckline because while this bra provides separation and lift, it my breasts are positioned |||1
farther apart than I normally prefer. It still keeps them within the frame of my body, which is what you want in a bra, but I do feel wider up |||1
top if I wear the above-mentioned tops. I could be having this issue because I decided to try a 30G instead of my normal 32F since whenever I check a |||1
calculator, it recommends the former size. The band feels good at a 30, but the cup might not be quite right. This is probably good evidence that you should always |||1
try on bras or their brands in-store before ordering online with a vendor that doesn't have the best return policy. If I had ordered this bra strictly through Amazon with |||1
Prime shipping, I might have returned it for a different size just to check if it was the bra itself or the fit. Overall though, great bra, well-made, and attractive. |||1
I will buy Fantasie bras in the future. |||1
For whatever reason, i cannot get this bra to lay smooth - gapping at the top and the size down is too small.... would have made a great seamless addition |||1
but i have to return it |||1
Cup is odd and puckers near the under arms. I've never had that in a bra before. Material is cheap and feels "scratchy. This bra went back. |||1
I have shopped at many bra shops in the US and Europe. If you are a 38G and short-waisted this bra is the one for you. I have paid over |||1
a hundred dollars in Houston for this bra, so to find it between forty and fifty dollars on Amazon is great. The bras are from England and the quality is |||1
excellent. The material the bra is made from never breaks down, it is the wire poking thru that signals that the bra is dead. When this happens I get out |||1
my sewing machine, fix the area and use it for another year or so. Even at one hundred dollars Fantasie bras are worth the price! |||1
I wish they had more colors!!!!!!. I am a 36DD and this bra actually makes me look smaller with better posture. I have been wearing Victoria secret bras for many |||1
years, but never get the support I need. The full size is very comfortable and the material is thin, which is what I wanted. I dont want to look larger. |||1
These are a very nice pair of stockings. They are thick, have nice shimmer, and will go great with my dress that I am wearing for the wedding. A very |||1
good bargain! |||1
I bought these in gray, black and brown, and I love every pair. They fit well and stay up! They wash well too (delicate/gentle cycle, drip dry). They provide a |||1
bit of tummy control. They are soft and sleek. I am a 1X. I recommend this hosiery! |||1
I'm really impressed with these shimmers pantyhose tights . They're warm and durable like tights but have a really sexy semi sheer, shimmery look to them like luxury pantyhose. .Great |||1
to wear with a mini and heels to really show off your legs and they'll still keep you warm.They fit fantastic and are very comfortable to wear for long days.They |||1
also give your legs support, feels like you wearing leggs sheer energy pantyhose . I've tried a lot of tights and these are one of the best and the price |||1
is reasonable.Love them! |||1
These are the most comfortable tights ever. They're soft, silky and I haven't fussed with them once. I've made these the new standard. :) |||1
Unfortunately these were much too small, even though I got the biggest size. I usually wear a 2x clothes, and the 5-6x didn't fit so that pretty much explains how |||1
small they run. |||1
I bought my first pair about four years ago and was quite pleased with them. They are like a heavy duty control top panyhose but they really lift and tuck |||1
the goopy stuff.Recently while trying on some new skirts I turned around and was dismayed at what appeared in the mirror! Horrors! My butt has gone south, but not to |||1
worry, I tried the said skirts on with my Spanx and that solved my problem. Now the twins back there look nice and perky...well, not like when I was 16, |||1
but maybe when I was a 33 year old dance teacher.The waist and thighs stay in place, no rolling there. Even though I'm a size 2 it does take a |||1
little more "work" to get these babies on. But once they are in place, wow! |||1
at first, I was a bit wary about buying them since I have thick thighs & worried that it'd cut into my legs & you'd totally be able to tell |||1
I'm wearing them. nope, not with these. I love them. they slim down my legs & love handles enough so I can wear a size lower than what I'd wear |||1
without them. easy to manage & they don't really roll down on the top unless I'm hunched over. I just have to make sure that they're pulled down far enough |||1
on my legs so they don't make any marks. (size 11/12 jean) |||1
They lift and hold in all the right places. Love them! Every girl needs a pare to have on hand. |||1
Purchased this for a wedding I attended. It worked very well and made me look good in my little black dress. Very comfortable to wear. |||1
not a good fit around the lower hips. but what I really like about them is that the material breathes. after I get used to the bad fit I forget |||1
they are there. waacoal feels the best but it is way expensive. |||1
They fit perfectly and really sucks in my tummy! Kind of hard to wear with jeans, but other materials work great. |||1
Just got my new pair, and for ME the secret was to go two sizes up. I am 5'4" and weigh 145... according to the chart I'm a B... but |||1
the C was even too small for me. Just got the D, and bingo! Perfect! Doesn't seem to roll, and I might actually be able to breathe in the thing. |||1
Those who haven't been happy before, try going two sizes up... worked for me~ five stars now!My previous review:I am completely torn about my rating on this one. On the |||1
positive side, this product shaves ten pounds off my appearance, easily. So five stars for that. Two negatives though... First, I ordered a size up (from what is recommended at |||1
Spanx.com), as everyone seems to suggest. They are still VERY tight, and still roll down. Secondly, I have not even worn them yet... I only tried them on twice with |||1
my Maid of Honor gown... maybe had them on for a total of fifteen minutes each time... and all of the stitching on the waistband started to come out in |||1
a big, long unravel. It happened in two different places on the waistband. If I hadn't bought them so long ago (well in advance of the wedding), I would have |||1
returned them and requested a new pair. Now, I'm here to order another pair, and I think that this time I'll try ordering two sizes up, and see if that |||1
stops the rolling problem. I will save the second, damaged pair as a backup for the wedding day. Those two issues caused me to take away two of the five |||1
stars that these could potentially be (for me, anyway). One more thing... as it stands now, I couldn't imagine wearing these every day... it really is a GIRDLE! But for |||1
a special occasion, or a night out on the town, yessiree!! They do really suck you in and give you that figure you wish you had! (Maybe not recommended for |||1
going out to dinner, if you plan to eat more than a salad LOL!) |||1
I understand that you have to have a seam somewhere in a garment, and it probably would make clothes look worse on the hip, but the seam going over the |||1
tummy looks horrible on garments, that you want your tummy hidden. Maybe it is just my pair, but you can totally see the seam over the tummy. I want that |||1
area to be smooth. Grrrrrr. |||1
I'm a reformed chubster so I'm still packing flab galore. I bought this to wear with a semi-fitted dress and shrug. Not exactly revealing, but I felt I needed the |||1
protection. Looked fine and liked the way this felt. It was not confining or uncomfortable. Did a good job and I felt confident.Yesterday it was frigid so I decided to |||1
use this as an extra layer under my jeggings that are fitted. I wasn't thinking in regard to hiding anything. I just wanted to stay warm. Anyway, when I put |||1
the jeggings on I thought they seemed baggy or loose. They've always felt fitted. When I met my friend for lunch she asked me if I was still losing weight |||1
because my pants were loose fitting. Ditto for my husband.Spanx work, but darn if I can explain it. They go on easily. While they are fitted to conform to the |||1
body they don't feel tight. They are comfortable enough that I forget I'm wearing them.I ordered a medium and since I normally wear an 8 or 10 they are true |||1
to size. I have friends who wear plus sizes and tell me the size they wear are consistent with the garment sizes they normally wear.I either hand wash or wash |||1
on a gentle cycle using Woolite and air dry. Just went out and bought two more pairs in tan and black. Can't put a price tag on confidence. |||1
OK, so I use these less as a tummy cinch, than I do as long underwear under a dress since my thighs brush together. And since there are no panty |||1
lines, it makes you feel more confident. I would buy multiples of these if they weren't so expensive. |||1
This product works exactly as stated on-line or in magazines. It does not roll at the edges and helps keep you together. |||1
These are terrific. I looked at the price and bought only one for testing and it blew me out of the water. Read the directions to get them on but |||1
they're worth every penny. I have bought more since due to their durability and delivering what they promised. I never feel compressed or pinched and they give a great silhouette! |||1
After several purchases, I'm beginning to feel that the extra $$$ for Spanx is not worth it. I think I'll stick to Flexees. |||1
Not sure -- bought it for a friend who is outside USA & cannot order herself. She obviously loves them, as this was a second order |||1
I've been wearing these for about 8 years. Through all my weight fluctuations they help my jeans, skirts and shorts look better. Initially they are a bit awkward to get |||1
on, but read and follow the directions patiently and you'll get them on. It gets easier each time. One reason they get easier to put on is because your butt |||1
leaves it's impression so it's always easy too know where the back side is. |||1
i found the same Spanx Power Panties at Nordstrom Rack for 19.99. Since these don't last through too many washes (maybe 8 tops!), I think spending $36.00 is just ridiculous. |||1
No thanks!!! |||1
to any wardrobe! The thing about these panties are: you HAVE to size up. If you are not sizing up, they are NOT going to fit right, or control what |||1
you need them to control. I bought one pair - according to the manufacturer's sizing - and quickly found out that they were too small. Tried the next size up, |||1
and got the rolling effect. Tried two sizes up and I was in the zone. They squoze in tight though, so I went three sizes up and found the pair |||1
for me. Now, I'm not saying that YOU have to go three sizes up to find the right pair for you, but it is doubtful that the right size will |||1
be your normal size. I would start two sizes up to be safe. This seems to be the general consensus from everyone that I know that owns a pair of |||1
these. Besides, who wants to feel like a stuffed sausage under your clothes?? Final word: buy the right size. Once you find it, you will see that these are a |||1
must. Let's face it, this designer found a niche in the market and now everyone is trying to capatilize on her initiative. Most of them do the trick, but how |||1
comfortable are you? The feel of these power panties are fabulous, and once you find the perfect size for you, you can be stylish, smooth, AND comfortable in your clothes. |||1
I don't leave home without mine! |||1
These goofy looking things are my favorite undergarments for just about everything. Great under snug clothing, they also create a great, smooth line under most everything else. Surprisingly, these are |||1
also really comfortable during warmer months. |||1
These do run small, when in doubt always go a size up. These are like very strong very tight pantyhose, I use them whenever I wear a dress because I |||1
like to walk and run around with my kids but don't want my legs to get irritated rubbing together and I like haveing something underneath for modesty. |||1
does I don't was very it was too small for me to too small I ordered the right side but it still to size smaller but thank you anyway for |||1
the product I just all I did was we sell to sell it thank you though |||1
I am a fairly thin person with a little extra weight in the upper thigh area and was hoping these could minimize the look under dresses or more fitted pants, |||1
but unfortunately they didn't seem to do anything for me. They were very tight and hard to get on, and once I did I still had the same lumps and |||1
bumps. Very dissapointed. |||1
I ordered this item for my wife after her pregnancy. She had reviewed the item online and decided to purchase it. The item was just as seen online and she |||1
is happy that it can be worn without anyone even noticing. |||1
These pants are thick, and they don't compress me very much, so they actually make my clothes fit tighter. Expensive and a waste of money. |||1
I love spanx, I've tried other brands includins VS and they are as good as these. Spanx manages to tuck everything in it's right place without being terribly uncomfortable, they're |||1
terrific! |||1
was bummed i didn't have these before i bought my dress. could have gone down a whole dress size. wow! what a difference they made. however, after wearing them for |||1
about four hours, i was eager to get them off. but no where near as bad as i expected. |||1
I love all spanx products. As I live in a warm climate the thin material is perfect for me. I highly recommend this product. |||1
I ckecked to see what size I should order. Following as it said to dam small. I think you should be able to breathe. |||1
You can't beat the quality of Spanx as long as you accept that you MUST order two sizes larger than the chart says you need. You will never get them |||1
on otherwise. (And if you do get them on, you'll be miserable.) Order two sizes up and they'll still be snug and hold down the jiggles. You'll feel confident and |||1
comfortable. These are perfect under skirts to keep you cool and prevent thighs from rubbing together. They also keep the skirt from sticking to your behind after you've been sitting. |||1
They're still a challenge to get on - especially after using a public restroom where you don't have a lot of room. Also, I can see where they'd be easy |||1
to snag with a rough fingernail or ring, so be careful. I really wish they'd make them in more sizes for larger bodies, but overall, they are awesome and worth |||1
the price. |||1
Its been a couple of years since I last bought Spanx, but these aren't exactly like the ones I already have. The panty isn't as substantial (the older ones are |||1
double layers) and the thighs don't stay in place like they use to. |||1
I had read and watched several articles and shows about this product and thought I would try a pair since I was going to a wedding. The panty was of |||1
nice quality but I do believe they should cost 25 dollars. The fit well for most of the evening but I did have to go to the ladies room twice |||1
because the waist was rolling down on me. From what I read this was not supposed to happen. Overall, I would not spend the money again on this product as |||1
I believe it should sell for no more than 15 dollars not 25 dollars. |||1
These are great to provide a little help and you can barely feel them. I just don't like any control garment that isn't a thong, personally - don't want anything |||1
that squashes my bottom since I don't need the compression help there. |||1
Maybe I got the wrong size although I went by the chart they had. I think is too tight around the legs and the waist rolls down a little bit. |||1
I tried one pair of the Spanx Power Panties (I ordered two pairs) and discovered the Spanx looked like a glorified panty hose. Yup. They reminded me of the girdle-type |||1
panty hose toppers. I also discovered the Spanx run a bit small as I ordered the size suggested using the Amazon size chart. I should have gone up one size.I'd |||1
suggest saving your money and buying a pair of girdle-type panty hose. They are cheaper and if you are wearing the panty hose for their girdle power they'll last a |||1
long time.I'm sending the second pair back, and would have sent both, except when I was attempting to try on the first pair the Spanx panty snagged. Not fair to |||1
send it back to the seller, so I will keep the Spanx Power Panty; and squeeze into it when needed.Recommend with caveats given. |||1
I'm addicted to Spanx! They make little pudges disappear. And Spanx don't lose elasticity. Remember girdles??? Well, Spanx is so much more comfortable and knit clothes fit smoothly. |||1
I LOVE these. I don't usually write reviews but I had to mention how comfortable these are. As a new mom to a 6 month old, I was starting to |||1
get self conscious about my baby belly so I ordered these. They are so comfortable and hide all of my "bumps". I'm buying more! |||1
unfortunately the legs were too long for one of my skirts and I could see the leg lines through my pants. They did slim me down though. |||1
I like this product because it hides my fat belly. I can wear tight dresses without my belly showing off. |||1
I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose. They're more like just cut-off regular pantyhose. There was no 'control' at all in the 4 |||1
pair I bought, following their sizing charts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find them too tight, in fact I thought they'd be tighter. Regular firm control briefs are better. Waste |||1
of money. |||1
I am 5'8", about 135 pounds, and the size B is basically what I expected. I wish they had a little more of a smooth finish so that fabrics glide |||1
over them a little more easily but I think these will do their purpose underneath a bridesmaids dress. There is not giant indentation for the waist or legbands though, which |||1
is nice. But I will not say they are comfortable... they do suck it all in. |||1
I ordered the right size.. and while I do like the spanx I just feel like they are a bit too tight. Over all thought does what it is suppose |||1
to do with out any lines. |||1
The item was exactly as described and is great to wear under maxi dresses. I would order in every color. |||1
ordered a number of these for bridesmaids because their dresses were a bit clingy and they really liked them! Great buy! |||1
It fits pretty much how it does on the model. Very light weight and good support. The material seems to be so light that I have to wonder how long |||1
they will last. Order the next size up! |||1
My husband only wears Jockey and we cannot find these local anywhere. He was shocked and pleased that I found these for him. They're the same quality he's used to |||1
and the shipping was very fast. |||1
Have not been able to find in stores for a few years. Husband loves these. Most undies are to baggie in the butt for him. These provide the support he |||1
likes and are not baggie. |||1
I wear a 32 pant in various brands, and have purchased Elance locally; these are super small fitting. Other brands of briefs I wear a medium, or a large if |||1
I want them loose fitting. These are like a sm/med...I've written to Jockey about this... |||1
He has been wearing these for years and is satisfied. The fabric wears very well. Happy husband = happy wife. |||1
Should have ordered the XL size. Good quality |||1
Excellent product, have been using this brand and style for as long as I can remember. I was able to get it at an incredible price on Amazon. So I |||1
bought several units. |||1
These are really sexy underwear i like to wear on a daily basis. I have a slim sexy body, and hate bulky under wears, so this fits me real nice. |||1
The price is great..also like the fact the advertising is at a minimal, just a tiny tag on the left side. my bf loves seeing me in these because it |||1
shows off my body which is a turn on for him ;) ya so go order these, or don't, more for me :) |||1
What can I say about Jockey underwear? They last a long time, come in some great colors, fit well and are inexpensive. I have tried other brands of underwear but |||1
it seems like I always come back to Jockey for one reason or another. They work for me and I would definitely recommend them. |||1
The waist fit fine but the overall fit was poor. The leg openings were tight and they would sit so low that they fell off my rear at times. especially |||1
if I was getting up and down. Definitely could not bend over in them. |||1
I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively, but in the past year they have changed their design. I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist |||1
and I have always worn the XL size. They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them. But the last few times I bought this product, |||1
they have a smaller, tighter fit. Very tight in the pouch and between the legs. They also have a lower cut, both in the front and back. I'm constantly pulling |||1
them up in the back. My junk is popping out of the top and the sides! These might fit a woman comfortably, but not a man. There's no stretchiness or |||1
room in the front for "the boys." This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal, Tactel or Nylon. I don't know why Jockey |||1
changed their design, but I don't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back. Sometimes change is a bad thing... and this is |||1
a bad thing!May sound odd, but Jockey makes women's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men! |||1
I would love to see Jockey get into the game of the higher end men's underwear. Make some different cuts, add some room for a pouch to open things up |||1
a little... Over all though, these are your basic, good, bikini briefs. |||1
We've bought these before and he still likes them. So we give them a five star rating and will buy them again when these wear out. |||1
Husband loves the fit and the way they feel. I think Jockey may be discontinuing this line as the price was great, and I could not find the Elance at |||1
the local department store. The only down side was that he wanted all black but could not order this color in the 3-pack. Shipping was good and the package arrived |||1
in good shape. |||1
These bikini's are very difficult to find in department stores, i.e., Wal-Mart, Ross, T.J. Max, etc. Buying the Jockey brand thru Amazon makes it very simple and gas-savings for my |||1
car. Thanks Amazon! |||1
I have always liked the quality of Jockey but when I recieved these they fit a little snug. I had to switch to a different brand. |||1
i bought these to replace the ones I had for nearly 5 years which had simply worn out. Normally I'd complain about thin material but these hold up and remain |||1
comfortable without binding. I wear them to workout and they take a beating pretty well. They also stretch a bit and with my, uh, size that's a plus. |||1
Bought this through amazon. Love this shoe . bought a taupe and a black pair. They have good arch support and can wear with dress or slacks.. |||1
I have worn these off and on all summer. They are comfortable. They keep their shape and color well. Nice purchase. |||1
I bought these shoes for my mom, and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them |||1
for years! Good thing there is amazon! She hasn't been able to find shoes as comfortable! She says size are true to size, and she wants me to buy another |||1
two pairs! Good to know I've made my mom happy! |||1
I like the shoes and over all they are pretty comfortable. They are easy and nice but a little narrow |||1
I love these shoes for work but they are a bit pricey. I bought a pair in black and navy - bye-bye $135 plus tax.I wish they came in a |||1
brown but the nearest they have is taupe or bronze and they are rarely available in my size... 9W. The "bronze" has been unavailable in my size almost a year.They |||1
are fairly true to size but still take a bit of wear before they are comfortable.They tend to pinch on the toes and I've had to treat several painful blisters |||1
as a result.I like the arch support and the small heel.The only drawback apart from the price is that the lining comes loose very quickly and then slides around inside |||1
the shoe which is uncomfortable and annoying. |||1
I bought these to wear for my fraternal organization meetings. I like the shoe, but the plastic heel is more beige in appearance than white. I'll use them for my |||1
local meetings. |||1
I have been looking for a shoe that I could be comfortable in. I have a wide foot, a bunion, and a ugly hammertoe,. I could never find a shoe |||1
that didn't bother one or the other until now. I love softspots anyway, but this shoe is perfect for me. |||1
These shoes are smart looking and can take you anywhere! I had to get a double wide to accommodate my "flip-flops all my life" wide feet, but they are like |||1
walking on pillows! Comfort at a decent price! |||1
Love these cotton undies. I especially like the ribbed leg holes. They are soft, comfy. The fabric is breathable. Nice white color. |||1
LOLLIPOP has long been a leading brand of 100% cotton underwear, and the quality is still very good. For everyday wear, I much prefer cotton over silk or nylon, because |||1
of cotton's superior comfort and absorbency. I've worn Lollipops since childhood, and I still prefer this "cotton leg band" or "cuff leg" model over the equally good model with the |||1
elastic cuff.The Lollipop package claims that "Lollipops keep their fit wash after wash without shrinking". Maybe that's true if you follow the recommendation to "machine wash cold, hang dry". However, |||1
my Lollipops are machine washed and machine dried with other whites (using settings for permanent press and low heat), and they ALWAYS shrink.To allow for shrinkage, I go up one |||1
or two sizes when I buy ANY brand of cotton panties. For Lollipops, the package recommends: size 5 (hips 36-37"); 6 (38-39"), 7 (40-41"), 8 (42-43"), 9(44-45"), 10 (46-47"), 11 |||1
(48-49"), and 12 (50-51"). I wear women's size 10/12 pants, and my hips measure 40" over clothing. I find that size 8 is my best choice for Lollipops. Either size |||1
7 or size 8 will work for me when new (7 fits, 8 fits loosely), but size 8 continues to fit after the panties shrink from multiple machine washings (and |||1
dryings). |||1
The panties fit exactly as I want them to do. They also appear to be extremely well made. I will definitely be ordering more when necessary. |||1
I just love having no tags.. I wish more items would have no tags. Panties are cotton making them cool and they breath. |||1
I much prefer the wider leg bands and far smaller leg openings in these Lollipop briefs. Compared to the regular Vanity Fair undies or several other brands, these are definitely |||1
the best fitting (they actually cover your butt!) and most comfortable. They do not seem to shrink when they are washed and the quality of the cotton seems like it |||1
will last quite a while. I did have a problem with the elastic coming loose at the side seam on one pair purchased a while ago but mended it by |||1
hand and it has been OK.Younger women might be comfortable in underpants that only cover part of their rear end and/or tummy but for old ladies like me, this style |||1
is perfect. They cover everything I want to have covered, right up to the waist! In fact, they come up higher than most of my jeans and other casual wear |||1
pants, but that's not a problem.I don't think anyone makes a cotton brief that will last 5 or 6 years like I used to buy from Jockey many years ago, |||1
but for what you can get these days at a reasonable price I think these are the best buy. |||1
IT WAS REALLY NICE FOR THE PRICE, IT WAS A REALLY NICE COSTUME FOR MY BABY, IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE AND I LIKE COLORS |||1
In fact, we still put the head piece on the kids sometimes, just for s**** and giggles. :) This was roomy on my the 16 month old, which was good |||1
since it allowed us to put a layer of clothing underneath. |||1
My one year old wore this for Halloween and he looked adorable in it. He even wore the hat without too much hassle. |||1
I bought this for my 8 month lean baby boy. I did have to take it in a bit (It is sized for 12 to 18 ), but it was |||1
easy to do. He loved it and had it on all night over his PJs. It is made with mobile babies in mind, not one hole. The top fit well |||1
on his head over top of a beanie (I put the beanie on first for a while till he was used to it, then added the top) he didn't even |||1
notice it (until the top would flip down, but to really a problem, flips back and is pretty sturdy) . |||1
This is absolutely adorable. I have the fussiest baby in the world. No really, he has won the Sleep-Fighting Championship of the World. When he's mad, he's mad. I bought |||1
this for him to wear at Halloween this year. For fun, we tried it on this weekend and it's awesome! Definitely worth the money. |||1
At least they are tight on me. I have a 38" waist, so ordered the 36-38" Large size. They fit, but are very tight. Next time I'll order XL. Other |||1
than that, I love the Kangaroo pouch style. For years I've worn Munsingwear's Kangaroo pouch briefs, but reviews on their latest product have not been good now that they're made |||1
in China, so I was happy to find Jockey making this style brief. I'm very happy with the quality... just should have ordered the larger size.... |||1
I don't like the traditional men's briefs - the pouch fits so much better - don't know why more men don't know this! |||1
Comfortable fit, size is perfect. the material washes beautlfully. Will stay with this brand. THe other brands will be discarded |||1
much better then any of the local stores had. I am going to get some more of these.. for cotton thee best ones yet. |||1
Comfortable, stout, quality underwear. The pocket seems to let heat rise which is handy. They nearly reach your belly button -- which makes them great choices when you don't want |||1
to tuck in your shirt (they protect your waist from rough jeans).After a month and four wash/wear cycles (hot water wash and high heat dry for "super-sterilization-ish-ness") they are still |||1
going strong. :)Munslingers, my old brand, have gone down in quality (i've thrown out brand new ones -- I can't in good conscience return worn underwear); stretched out elastic, no |||1
support, too loose or too tight elastic (one leg hole might be tight, the other leg hole too loose -- really horrible situations that make 'em unwearable).I expect to buy |||1
only these Jockeys for many many years. |||1
Best briefs on the market. I have worn Jockey Pouch Briefs for many years and they last and are very comfortable and move with you. Love them. |||1
I've been wearing Jockey underwear for years and you can't beat this brand.They are constructed well and wear like iron.I do like the choice of many colors.Amazon, as usual, has |||1
the best prices around . |||1
These briefs are the only style my husband will wear. They fit very comfortably, and they wash and last very well. they can be ordered in all black, which is |||1
what he likes. |||1
Great price. Even cheaper then at Jockey outlet stores. My husband has worn these type for 40 years and will not wear any other kind. Loves them.. |||1
When I ordered this product there were 2 colors offered - white and black. Should be clear as black and white, right? But the color picture of the "black" shorts |||1
showed as grey which was my preference. I figured the pictured color was considered black. Drat, wrong again. The shorts arrived and are a very black black, not a grey |||1
black. Not a big complaint for me but still a little annoying. Everything else appears OK. |||1
It might work for a Superman costume, but Spider man is supposed to be a weedy teenager. So it looks funny. My little boy's Spiderman PJs are more convincing than |||1
this thing. |||1
my son loves it. Wish the face mask is more breathable or he can see better, but the suit is great. |||1
I don't think this costume has changed any since one of my older boys wore one years ago. Fun costume that has held up well even after Halloween for regular |||1
play time.One word of caution, buy a size larger than you think you need. My boy wears a 5/6 normally, and the 7/8 costume just fit. With a layer of |||1
warm clothes underneath he was stuffed tight. |||1
This is a simple, fun costume. We purchased this for our Spiderman obsessed son for dress-up fun, and it has stood up to a year's worth of friends and many |||1
hours of play. I would recommend. |||1
I bought big and I am glad I did. My son wear a four and I bought a 7, there is a little growing room, but since this was bought |||1
for dress up play it works perfect. |||1
I used Domke bags several years ago when I worked as a news photographer. The design was/is one of the best around for a bag to work out of rather |||1
than just to carry equipment. I liked the bag for its "floppiness" and its ability to mold itself to your body when carried. The biggest problem with the bags--and I |||1
saw this in virtually every Domke bag being carried by news photographers at the time--was that they wore through due to friction. Carrying it every day meant it rubbed against |||1
your side and mine eventually wore a big hole in the back. The only other problem I had with the bag was the lack of weather proofing. Being cotton, when |||1
they got wet they stayed wet for a long time.I switched to a waterproofed nylon bag but it had its own problems. Zippers wore out and the rough nylon rubbed |||1
against and wore spots on my jackets.Bottom line is--there is no perfect camera bag. The best I've found has been the Billingham brand (those are 5-star bags). They are dense-weave |||1
cotton with a waterproofing applied. They don't wear as easily and they don't absorb water. They're as easy to work out of as a Domke. They cost a LOT more, |||1
however.I like the Domke bags as a less expensive alternative to the Billinghams. I still like to transport equipment in heavily padded, waterproof nylon bags but, more often than not, |||1
I'll carry a Domke or Billingham canvas bag when I'm actually shooting photos. |||1
Beautiful bag. Holds my Nikon D5200 and four lenses and also my Panasonic video camera. Lots of handy little pockets to hold manuals or filters or battery chargers. Perfect to |||1
keep everything together in one place. |||1
My Domke F-2 arrived yesterday along with the extra padded internal compartment.I decided against the waxed leather because of the reviews where people said that the wax would rub off |||1
and instead went with Olive Drab.I moved my outfit into the bag and found that it could hold more than I expected, but of course a lot less than my |||1
much larger backpack.The Canon 5D Mark III fits with either the 50mm f/1.4 or the 20-35mm F/2.8L mounted. The 70-200mm f/2.8L IS will just fit in the compartment with the |||1
lenshood reversed. However, the mounting end sticks "up" a little more than I would really like. The biggest thing I noticed was a lack of padding in the top flap, |||1
I can "feel" the endcap on the 70-200 through it. There is a zippered inside pocket on the flap, so I'll probably insert a piece of thinsulite or thin foam |||1
in it to give it just a little more padding on top as a "comfort"I fit the above lenses, the 2x teleconverter, 430EXii Flash, and accessories inside the main compartment. |||1
It's snug, but workable. If I need more than that, I'd probably carry the full size backpack instead (even with the extra weight)I like the well made clips, backed up |||1
with a large velcro closure. While the velcro is not "silent" for street shooting, the combination will help to make sure that the bag stays closed.The strap is nice and |||1
wide, fully adjustable and goes all the way under the bag for extra strength. There are two large end pockets big enough to carry accessories. Fully loaded, it is heavy, |||1
but manageable.Since I didn't get the waxed leather, I plan on spraying it down with some Kiwi Campdry or ScotchGuard to give it a little water repellancy on the outside.After |||1
the next few weeks of trips I'll update |||1
3 Stars for a beautiful bag. It is exactly what I wanted. However, I thought the partitians would be fully adjustable...they are not. The only interior layout this bag has |||1
is a four-part partition quadrant held in place by velcro. If you remove the partition, it's just an empty space with no partitians.The quadrant partitian is moveable left and right |||1
from extreme side to side. However, the partitians inside the quadrant itself are not adjustable. You cannot adjust the sizes of the four partitians inside this moveable quadrant which is |||1
the only partitian system in this bag.I could not fit my Canon EF 100-400 L IS into any of the equally sized partitians inside the quadrant. I could have moved |||1
the quadrant all the way to one side, but then the slot would have been too large for the lens and would have left no place for my Canon 30D. |||1
The fixed partitian quadrant takes up over 2/3rds of the interior of the bag.Taking the quadrant partitian out, leaves you an empty cavity necessitating using the cases your lens came |||1
in....unless you're ok with them just rattling around in there.If you have small, thin lenses...this might work.....but there is no customizing of the interior partitian arrangement.If this bag had moveable, |||1
individually adjustable partitian panels, it would be wonderful. With only one non-adjusting quadrant....it was not acceptable.A very minor point: I didn't like the clips on the front holding the top |||1
flap down, two of them, are very small. The clips need to be updated with either larger ones or the plastic type used by many bag manufacturers.....retro is nice, but |||1
a little updating is also good.Thank you Amazon for standing behind your sales; I returned the bag. |||1
I've never seen a modestly sized bag hold so much stuff, comfortably. I have a couple larger bags that -technically- hold more, but in some weird configuration so that I'm |||1
always packing and unpacking. Domke bags are designed by a photographer for photographers, and it shows. I started filling this bag, and just 'knew' where to put everything - and |||1
I don't have to remove more than one item to get to whatever I need. Comes out of the box looking a bit 'lived in', and not obviously a camera |||1
bag, which is a plus when traveling. The metal clips that back up the velcro top closure could be easier to manipulate, but -- great bag! |||1
I like the style. it's water repellant and it is a no-frills bag. I don't need all of that extra foam. I may need to whop somebody with my bag |||1
full of lenses someday and I want it to count, should the opportunity dictate such a defensive action.It holds everything I need for specific assignments.It's made in the USA too! |||1
I used a Domke F 2 bag back when I was photojournalist. I stopped using it about 20 years ago and went with other brands. I'm trying to get back |||1
in the business again, and feel the F 2 is the way to go. It gives me plenty of room for camera and lenses plus my flash. I dig the |||1
look of the sand bag, and the straps work great. I really like Domke products, and will never switch again. |||1
I've got this bag 2 months back. It currently fits a Nikon d300, 17-55, 70-200, Sigma 10-20, Nikon 50mm f1.8, sb400, extra battery, couple lens filters.Pros:-construction. This bag is built |||1
very well. Material used seems of high quality, and the stitching is excellent. I really like the straps mechanism, as they feel very secure. The main strap also has some |||1
kind of rubbery strips on them, which helps keep the strap from sliding off your shoulder (and have your thousands of dollars come crashing on the ground)There is also a |||1
smaller hand strap, as opposed to the main sling strap, which is very convenient for helping you precisely lift the bag and place it, which I really like)-discreetness. This bag |||1
doesn't look like a typical photography bag, but rather just a standard sling bag. Makes me more comfortable when carrying it though airports, or places that I am not familiar |||1
with.-comfort. This bag is very comfortable to carry, even fully loaded, for hours. Because of the canvas nature of the bag, it molds to your body (assuming you pick it |||1
right), which makes it feel more secure at your side.Cons.-padding. This bag does not have too much padding, (it comes with a 4 compartment padding sleeve, which i have converted |||1
to a 2+1+1 padding sleeve, to fit my 70-200 lying at an angle), and no padding at all on the top. I think the padding is adequate, but probably could |||1
be improved.-price. Compared to other equivalent photo bags, this bag seems a little pricey.-weather proofing. This bag does not come with a waterproof cover, though, from what I read from |||1
other review, it is pretty waterproof, however, in pouring rain, I'm pretty sure that it will drench through. (not quire sure what you would be doing in pouring rain with |||1
your equipment). This can be fixed by packing a large garbage bag with you all the time, tacky but works.All in all, this is a very nice photographer's bag. Highly |||1
recommended. |||1
I know these are sold for boys, but I wear a 8 (sometimes 8.5) in women's and these are great. I bought a size 6.5 and they fit with plenty |||1
of room. They are also extremely comfortable for boots. I cannot wait to wear these through the Michigan winter and see how they hold up! |||1
When I first put these shoes on they screamed quality and sturdiness. I knew that they were going to last me for quite a long time. The price was also |||1
a plus since the adult sizes are a good 30 dollars more expensive. I am a women's 7.5 and got a kids 6 and it fit perfectly with a little |||1
bit of wiggle room.Timberland boots are making a comeback in the style trend. Numerous celebrities are pairing them up with skinny jeans or tights and they just add a nice |||1
touch to any wardrobe. They are very attractive and you can't go wrong with them for casual wear.Something I must not is that your must wear thick socks with these. |||1
I tend to get blisters on my feet if I don't. I must also not that these boots will wear down your feet. After wearing them for 8 hours walking |||1
a good bit, my feet felt like they were about to fall off from the rest of my body. If you are doing a lot of walking around you might |||1
need to reconsider your desire to buy these.In the end, I am highly satisfied with these shoes. They are just great and durable! |||1
Exactly what I ordered and fit great. Im not sure if they are really waterproof, but i bought them to walk on rocks in Afghanistan and they work great for |||1
that. |||1
My 10yr old Daughter has hard to fit feet, to say the least! We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel's or other high end stores. 99% |||1
of the time, we get her shoes, sneakers or boots, she wears them 1-2x's & complains about the fit! I'd about had it & was thinking it would cost less |||1
to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot!!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver ( hers anyway!) I bought NB wide $40 sneakers & she LOVES |||1
them, wearing them consistently 3-4 times a week. Snow came & we had problems...... Uggs are her fav pair yet they aren't for snow & rain :( so the hunt |||1
was on! Cheap ones, wide, xtra wide, expensive ones, ones we'd never heard of- ALL didn't fit...then, looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here- I found |||1
THESE. Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse, so I worried. I waited days, looked again, 1left in |||1
her size 5.5 wide! I grabbed em' , I was desperate! They came today- I was shaking, she was scared yet another wouldn't fit... Well Dear Lord she put them |||1
on & ran around the house smiling & yelling "I LOVE EM' "!! She has a EE width, yet these in just wide fit perfect! I am now looking to |||1
buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon! Made well, soft leather & the sole is |||1
flexible. A great boot- |||1
Love these boots. Have this style in about 7 colors. These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo |||1
pants. I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new. Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch. |||1
Good support. |||1
Really happy with the quality of these sturdy kids work-boots with soft uppers and sturdy build, my son just loves them, and I was really pleased too, fast ship too! |||1
these children tims fit perfectly, I wear a size 6.5 women and i purchased a 4.5 childrens and it fits perfectly. Also know that children sizes compare with women sizes... |||1
love love love these fits good got them for a good price great for this time of weather thanks amazon |||1
I absolutely idolize Kylie Jenner's sense of style, so I had to purchase a pair of Timberlands. They were delivered super fast and I got a really good deal on |||1
them since I bought them in children's size. I am a size 7 (sometimes a 6.5) in women's and I got these shoes in a children's size 5.5. They fit |||1
great! They're kind of heavy, so it takes a while to get used to walking in them but they look amazing. These shoes are very durable and great quality, so |||1
you can tell that they'll last for a long time. |||1
My son like the boot, it fit well and is water proof. We received the boot just a few days after ordering it. |||1
My boys go through shoes like water, but this is one sturdy shoe! Strong, durable, really nice looking and comfortable. Would definitely buy again! |||1
I'm a merrell shoe person and love that's all I wear.im a diabetic and MERRELLS is the best wearing shoes for meYES I recommend these shoes |||1
I usually have an extra wide width with shoes. I bought this same shoe in a different color way back when in a MEDIUM width. To my surprise, it fit |||1
perfect. I ordered this shoe on amazon in medium width and it still fit perfect. They are very comfortable, easy on and off, nice shoe to wear with shorts |||1
I BOUGHT THESE FOR SOMEONE ELSE, SO I CANNOT SPEAK AS TO HOW HE LIKES THEM. I GUESS HE MUST LIKE THEM THIS IS HIS 5TH PAIR OF MERRELL. JUST |||1
DIFFERENT COLORS. |||1
Very pleased with these shoes really are very c'nomodos both so they buy another pair but different color. Highly recommended. |||1
Way too big, even though I usually wear a 10.5EE. Had to return for a 10, which was still too big. |||1
We love these shoes. They have a perfect fit and are very comfortable. They are very durable. Very good product. |||1
Great pair of shoes , they are almost made for all kind of use and they look great whit jeans. Super comfortable. |||1
I know how long they lasted because my Amazon purchase history shows when I bought the last pair, on 11/27/10. I know they lasted more than 2,000 miles because I |||1
always wore these shoes when I walked my dog and that was twice a day, one mile each time. I wore them on other occasions as well and figured I |||1
would go with the most conservative values which to me are still pretty impressive.After all this the soles started to wear, I figured it was time to get a replacement |||1
"dog walking shoe" and ordered the same shoe again. The size, 12W, was dead on and the shoes are as comfortable as before. They are still light, and have an |||1
effective tread without looking clunky. |||1
My dad has bad knees and asks me to get these for him. He really likes the comfort of them, the style and the ease of putting them on. He |||1
has had several pair and they all seem to be great |||1
These shoes are probably the most comfortable I own. I'd been thinking about getting a pair for years because of all the positive reviews so I finally pulled the trigger. |||1
Good call, because they are super comfy and easy to slip on and off. On the downside though they are black seude shoes. I must not have looked closely enough |||1
because I thought they were just black leather. I suppose I just don't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes. I power through it though because |||1
these things are so comfortable. They'll work great for casual wear in the winter/fall, but come summer spring I don't see myself sporting these shoes with shorts. They really only |||1
work with jeans.Fit was as expected, unlike Keens that usually need a 1/2 size bigger. |||1
Fit good, put them on and spent the day in them. Easy slide on and would recommend them to any one. |||1
Got these for my Dad. They are his favorite shoe and this is the best price that I found on the internet. He likes the comfort and the simplicity of |||1
them |||1
These are comfortable shoes and do fit good all around but the vendor could have but a more deeper tread on them for a better grip on trail walks. |||1
These are the best fitting, best wearing shoes I've come across. I have a pair for dress, and when they get weathered I wear them for casual. Then I wear |||1
them for yard work and then they get tossed. I keep three pair in rotation.I would recommend these shoes to anyone, family or friend. |||1
I ordered the black leather jungle moc and received a suede pair. I called customer service and they said they would send the black leather pair overnight. When I opened |||1
the box, the shoes were BLACK SUEDE AGAIN. I called customer service and the woman did not know the difference between suede and leather. I am a server in a |||1
fine dining restaurant. I cannot wear suede shoes. I am returning these again. A total waste of my time. |||1
Pro: Comfortable fit, good looking shoes, great traction on dry surface.Con: slippery on certain wet concrete surface or certain wet tiles. Wet roads or paths are alright.Overall: Good shoes that |||1
I will buy again as I am using it mostly on dry surface at work. |||1
I purchased these shoes for my husband in the gunsmoke brown color. They are very nice looking shoes. My husband says they fit him perfectly and are extremely comfortable to |||1
wear. In fact, he likes them so much that he will hardly take them off. I'm planning to order him another pair in a different color soon. |||1
I am on my second pair of these shoes. I wore the first pair out after about 3 years of wearing them nearly every day even in the winter. Even |||1
then I kept them for work shoes since they were still functional but looked really beat up. I'm still wearing my second pair but don't wear them very often once |||1
the snow hits. This pair is on around year 3 also and the soles are completely flat in some spots now. The elastic is stretched permanently and the adhesive is |||1
coming undone around the toes. Some of the rubber is starting to deteriorate along the sides but he leather has no holes or tears. The built in plastic support around |||1
the ankle area has cracked on both shoes. Nevertheless, they are still functional and extremely comfortable. They keep my feet warm enough in the winter for casual wear but I |||1
would not dare use them for winter hiking or other winter sports for fear of frostbite. Their dry traction seems to be pretty good and wet traction is decent. Overall, |||1
these are a very good shoe. My measured shoe size is between 9.5 and 10 (closer to 10) but this shoe in 9.5 fits perfect. If I had to approximate |||1
my exact size I'd be probably a 9.9. |||1
Great slip-on shoe. I have been wearing these shoes for a couple of years and they are very comfortable. Only shortcoming is the non-replaceable sole, so when the sole wears |||1
out you have to buy a new pair (which I have done). |||1
These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I've been wearing Merrill shoes for years and refuse to put my feet in anything else. |||1
The first time I saw Mocs, I thought they were ugly shoes. But wearing them is a different story- they are SO comfortable. It's the only shoe I've worn for |||1
about 15 years now. I used to buy them from REI, but REI only carries standard widths (at least the store I go to does) and Amazon had them in |||1
wide, which is what I prefer. |||1
If you are looking for a supportive, comfortable slip-on for work or for casual wear, you may want to consider "Merrell Jungle Moc" slip-ons. These shoes are not light in |||1
weight; the pair (size 10 1/2D) weighs approximately 1 lb. 12 5/8 oz. The suede is a good quality and finish on these slip-ons is clean and well done. Interior |||1
seams are clean and the lining is soft and cushioned. The soles are rubber and, if wearing these on wet surfaces, help prevent slipping.Because "Merrell Jungle Moc" are not flexible |||1
but are somewhat wide, you may find it necessary to order a smaller size than you normally wear. My spouse wears an 11 D in Brooks running shoes and an |||1
11D in most conventional shoes. The "Merrell Jungle Moc" slip-ons that fit comfortably and did not gap or slide were a size 10 1/2D. From the middle of the front |||1
to the center of the heel, the interior measurement on a 10 1/2D is approximately 11 ". At the ball of the foot, the interior width is approximately 3 "; |||1
at the heel, approximately the interior width is approximately 2".Individuals having more sensitive feet may find the point at which the sole joins to the shoe, near the ball of |||1
the foot, somewhat irritating. It was for this reason that my spouse purchased "Skechers GoWalk2" shoes and returned the "Merrell Jungle Moc" slip-ons. Overall had his right foot not been |||1
so sensitive, he would have kept them as he did like these shoes. |||1
I've owned a bunch of Merrells, mostly of the "moc" variety. Nothing negative on this particular model, though I can't yet comment on durability. However, past Merrells have held up |||1
nicely; the outsoles always wear down smooth long before the uppers are ready to pack it in. The one thing I notice with this model is that the sizing seems |||1
to run a tad larger than my other Merrell mocs -- I ordered the same size I always have, but this pair fit a smidge looser than I expected. Without |||1
a comparison, I can't say if a 1/2 size smaller would fit better. |||1
Merrell's WERE great, perhaps when they were made in Canada. These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc's I wore comfortably in and out |||1
of the house for years, but my heel slipped a lot in these, there was way too much toe room, and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large. I |||1
wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5's. I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva's. I do not recommend these, I would not buy |||1
again, and I hope this helps someone. |||1
Good traction, fits well and seems to have extra cushion or sole in the heal area. Stepping in them you will notice they are taller than a tennis shoe and |||1
more like a boot as far as adding a little height in the sole. First couple of times I wore them I wasn't sure what all the hype was about |||1
but by the fourth or fifth time I was quite pleased. Will be interested to see how well they hold up over time and use. |||1
The shoe looks as described at Amazon. I really wanted the 12 1/2 size but it would not have been eligible for the free shipping and two day delivery because |||1
Amazon does not stock that size but can get it from another store. The shoe is tight but is not uncomfortable even after long periods of standing and walking around. |||1
I think I will like this shoe unless it has traction problems on wet surfaces. Other reviews don't seem to indicate that. |||1
Bought them for my husband. He loves them, very comfortable and easy to put on and my take off. And he's very picky |||1
Merrell Men's Jungle Moc Slip-On,Gunsmoke,13 W is a not so good fit for my son. I wish Merrell made more WIDE and extra-wide shoes. These were a struggle to get |||1
on over socks. After a couple of weeks he admitted to me that he could not wear them but was unable to find the box and receipt for a few |||1
days but when he did he brought them over to me. We printed off a return label and immediately took them to UPS for a return. The easy Amazon refund |||1
only took a few days. |||1
I have had some of the cheaper versions of these and the Merrells are definetely a cut above. Better arch support and so on. I expect they will wear a |||1
lot better as well. Sizing is true to size. It would be nice if they made them in narrow sizes for guys like me though. |||1
These were a Christmas gift for my husband. He LOVES them. They fit well, are very comfortable and have great traction. I'm sure he will get a lot of use |||1
out of these shoes and will be back to buy more. |||1
I must like these shoes, this is my fourth pair, and they're all still in use. I discovered Merrell's hiking shoes maybe 10-12 years ago, and always found them to |||1
be well made, durable and comfortable. The jungle mocs continue the tradition, and add the convenience of being a slip-on. This makes them my go-to shoes for a run out |||1
to the mailbox, for any activity that involves walking, yard work (the oldest pair), etc. They are also good looking enough for business casual wear at the office, going well |||1
with khakis or jeans on casual Friday. |||1
These seem to be great overall quality, and fit just like expected. Just thought I'd add that the "slip on/off" factor in these comes together really well. Some lace-less shoes |||1
end up getting a bit weird when you actually try to just kick them on, these don't roll or jam up on your foot, the elastic lets them slide on |||1
nicely. |||1
I bought these for my 92 yr old father in law and he loves them, they are comfortable and easy for him to put on. So when he goes to |||1
bingo he is styling |||1
My husband will not wear anything but Merrell shoes anymore. He has een wearing them for a number of years now and absolutely loves them |||1
These shoes are the most comfortable and durable that I have found. My feet are big and wide, and I am greatly satisfied. The sizes do vary a little depending |||1
on the color (I have found that Charcoal runs smaller than Gunsmoke). |||1
Didn't like the look of them when I took them out. Should have inspected at the store but did not. As always Amazon delivered and with no questions asked took |||1
them back! Awesome. |||1
Love Merrell ever since I bought my first pair and they lasted me 5 years. Very durable and comfortable. Just wish they were available locally. Not overly fond of having |||1
to buy shoes online. |||1
My husband had a pair of Merrell's similar to these that we purchased in 2007. He loved them and they're still in really good shape, but they don't look as |||1
nice for dressing up anymore. So, we ordered these and he loves them! Great support, looks great, and comfortable...what more is there to say? |||1
Very good quality slip-on. The arch is a little high for me. If your going to wear anything but thin socks, I would get a 1/2 size bigger. |||1
My husband loves these shoes and wears them all the time. |||1
I just received my order, & with the help of a shoehorn (normal procedure for me) got them on just fine. So far they seem to fit well, I find |||1
them comfortable to walk in, & the traction is good -- especially needful as I have balance problems.I'll seriously think of getting another pair when I need new ones! |||1
I bought these for the arch support for standing hours on end in surgery with my flat feet, but the toe box is narrow so when my feet move forward |||1
even a little, my toes painfully hit the sides and top of the toe box. If it hurts after a few minutes, it would cripple me by the end of |||1
a day. But very attractive, great soles and great arch support. Wish they'd fit. |||1
My husband has a well worn pair of these shoes and loves them. So, we went for another pair which felt a little tight on one foot, but he knows |||1
the shoe seems to mold too his feet. Very easy to care for and comfortable shoes. |||1
These are my everyday shoes, I have been wearing Merrells for about six years. As soon as a pair gets a little tired, I buy another pair. |||1
I bought this based on the brand and good reviews. My husband loved it. Very comfortable and good fit! Will buy again in the future. |||1
Ten years ago, my husband bought a pair of these Merrell shoes locally. They were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn. Now (10 years later), after wearing these |||1
shoes on a daily basis, they have finally bit the dust. We bought the same version from Amazon to replace his old Jungle Slip-on's, and the new ones are just |||1
as comfortable. Out of the box, there's no break-in period needed -- he can wear them all day, with nary a blister. |||1
I've tired imitation Merrell mocs in the past. They fit just fine and lasted forever, but the comfort wasn't even close.While an imitation isn't uncomfortable it doesn't have the arch |||1
support or contoured sole that the Jungle Mocs have.I normally wear a D-E width shoe and these. I did buy the D as I though the EE would be too |||1
wide. The D does run narrow. If you are on the wider side I'd suggest going to the EE. Other than the slightly narrow fit, great shoe. |||1
I have been wearing Merrells for a while and highly suggest them for anyone that has trouble finding comfortable shoes. I must say that I prefer the Jungle Moc Nubuck, |||1
Brown Nubuck but it seems that the Brown Nubuck are being discontinued for the present time and it's hard to find the Brown Nubuck. I decided to try Men's Merrell |||1
Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown and was very satisfied with every thing but the color. The Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown is not mahogany at all, not even close |||1
but rather a tan looking color. Beware that the Mahogany Brown as shown in the picture is not the correct color. It is a very light brown or tan colored |||1
shoe. I almost sent them back but the return time frame closed on me. If you like a lighter colored shoe this is a great and comfortable shoe. I do |||1
like the new sole on this shoe. It has a better grip support sole that the older Merrells. It is made of all smooth leather and not suede like most |||1
other Merrells. |||1
My "old" pair sole finally wore down and I realize that this is my third pair. I'm a 10.5-11 and the 11's fit me well, so plan accordingly. |||1
If you are not playing sports why wear sneakers. These Merrell's are great comfort and look good too. No breaking in even . Wear well, and clean up well too. |||1
I have been buying Jungle Mocs for my wife for years and finally said, what the hey, I should try them myself and so I bought them and now understand |||1
why my wife and everyone loves them,. Give your tired feet a present of a snuggly yet supportive shoe you can wear anywhere. |||1
I got these shhoes for my father who loves going hiking and he really loves them, he now wears them everyday for the morning walk. |||1
These shoes shipped fast and fit perfect. I needed work shoes to wear during 12 hour shifts in an ER. These are awesome for that. They support my feet and |||1
they do not rub my toes raw. They are also easy to put on and pull off. They are not the best looking shoes though. My wife makes fun of |||1
them all the time on me but I don't care. They feel amazing. Perfect shoes for work but I would not wear them out in town or on date night. |||1
My wife and I both buy Merrell's and love them. It is all about being comfortable, and getting great wear out of this shoe. When I have purchased a product |||1
less expensive in the past, I got exactly that...an uncomfortable shoe, or one that did not last long. No problem with Merrell's...I purchased them with confidence. |||1
I hate tying shoes... and these slip-ons keep me from having to do that. They are super-high quality, fit great, have great tread, and look great as well. |||1
This shoe is extremely comfortable, looks good and is convenient. Slips on and slips off. No laces to tie or untie. Really great for traveling and going thru those irritating |||1
TSA checkpoints at the airports. The seller however I can not recommend. When I orderd my Merrells, the seller had them listed as in stock, yet it took two emails...the |||1
second one threatening cancellation to finally get them shipped two weeks later. BTW...this is my second pair. The first pair were bought for me at a Merrell Store in Birmingham, |||1
Alabama and they are still going strong. Just wanted another color. |||1
Bought these for my husband who has bad feet and he loves them. He doesn't need to wear his orthotics! |||1
Merrell makes extremely comfortable slip ons with good durability. The W offers some more room for wider feet than the M. Shoe offers good grip for traction as well. |||1
These are the nicest shoes a guy could ask for. Fit like a sneaker and look really nice for casual wear. I really like them a lot. |||1
I have been wearing Merrell's for about 12 years. These are some of the best feeling, best fitting shoes I have ever worn and the Jungle Moc is my personal |||1
favorite! |||1
These shoes are comfortable, but the are a little bigger than normal.That doesn't bother me because they are slip ons anyway. |||1
Great shoes and really well made. The only area that has issues is the glue on the elastic at they top of the shoe, but that hasn't been a big |||1
deal yet. |||1
My husband wears nothing but this shoe and of course Merrel sandels in the summer time. He says the support in these shoes is the best he has every had. |||1
These were purchased to wear on his daily morning walk with our dogs. |||1
I just got these this morning and haven't taken them off yet. I may sleep in them! They fit true to size, easy on/easy off and very comfortable. Even better, |||1
I live at a ski resort and the soles on these shoes are incredible on snow and ice. I had the Merrell Shivers, which were warmer, but very slippery on |||1
ice.Merrell makes a lot of different soles. The ones I got look like they have octopus suckers on the sides and little square nubs in the center. Very bizarre looking |||1
but very sticky. These soles come on the standard Jungle Mocs.Edited 11/30/12: I just got my second pair. What a difference. As great as these shoes are they don't last |||1
forever, so treat yourself to a new pair when the soles wear down. They feel awesome again! |||1
I have many other pairs of 9.5 W shoes and they all fit just fine. These arrived and while the box said 9.5 W, the tag inside the tongue said |||1
9.5. So now I have to wonder if they just dont put the W on the inside tag, or if they shipped the wrong product.I tried them on and WAY |||1
TOO TIGHT! Obviously these are not a proper wide size so now I have to wonder if all Merrells are a snug fit and Wide really just means Normal, or |||1
if I got the wrong product. Since no store anywhere in 50 miles of me keeps the wide sizes in stock, I will never know.They look nice and seem like |||1
they'd be comfortable if they are the right size, and I think they provide good traction on slick surfaces, but since I am returning them I didnt feel like making |||1
a trip around the block. Shame, because I think these are exactly what I need for walking around this winter.Be aware if you have wide feet you probably will not |||1
be able to find comfortable Jungle Moc's. |||1
Wow, these are just SO comfortable to wear. I've worn so many different kinds of shoes over the years. A $400 pair of dress shoes may have some comfort when |||1
on your feet for ten hours, but these are just like walking on air. I've put on a few pounds and my feet are not as forgiving as in my |||1
youth, but these are some of the most comfortable footwear I've ever worn! In a weeks time I've had three strangers stop me and ask about them, and another two |||1
have said, they own 'em and yes, it isn't just me, these Merrell Jungle Mocs are truly comfortable. I've never recommended shoes before, but I'd recommend considering these for real |||1
comfort. |||1
Nice shoes but run very large. I wear 11 W in Brooks and New Balance so I ordered 11 W in these. The length was right but the width was |||1
considerably wider than the Brooks or New Balance of the same size. |||1
So the arches are really hard and pronounced, and they are not the same on each foot, another reviewer said he had a defective left shoe, well I think I |||1
got the matching right side. I've been trying to stick it out for a week, even directly putting my heel and all my weight on the arch to try and |||1
"break it in" but it's not budging and I'm going to end up limping if I try to keep it up. The first day I wore them, it took me |||1
a couple of days for my arch to recover, I thought I had just hit it wrong or something.The styling and design of the shoe is great, so it is |||1
disappointing that it is not comfortable, I really wanted to like these shoes, I guess I'll see if I can send them back because they are defective. |||1
These are very comfortable and I wear them on occasions that are not casual enough for myMerrell Men's Moab Ventilator Multisport Shoe. They're great for weekend days when I have |||1
to go to work or even a semi-casual night out.The uppers are suede and I've been a bit worried about damaging them, but so far, they've held up quite well.I |||1
bought size 10.5 and they fit well. |||1
First let me say I love merrell shoes in general - worn them for years. This is the first time I've tried this tyle and thhey spueak when I walk |||1
- right out of the box. Can't tolerate that. |||1
I have worn these for a few years and these are to replace the older ones. they are comfy and slip on easily.good traction on wet surfaces. the last ones |||1
seemed to rip at the flex points quite quickly but were still comfy and I still wear them to do outdoor work. |||1
They are my son's 5th pair. He only wears Merrell jungle moc since he was 8 years old. He loves them. |||1
Seems lately the shoes you get are getting shorter or narrower or just don't fit. Had a few pairs of Romeos and all pairs hurt my feet. Was skeptical about |||1
these Merrell Jungle Mocs but the 100s of reviews were outstanding so I tried them.wow, glad I did! Told my wife I will need a nw pair soon because these |||1
will be worn out from constant wear. Now she wants a pair. Oh, did I forget to say, they are good looking, too! |||1
I have been purchasing the Men's Merrell Jungle Moc for about six years now. I have deteriorating Cartilage my knees. This is complicated by the fact that I am teacher |||1
who has to be on his feet most of the day. The cushioning of the Jungle Moc actually takes pressure of my knees. It is a great product, and the |||1
vendor delivered them in no time at all. |||1
my husband has parkinsonism - these shoes are great --forming stability in his walk-they are also wonderful for a man with a long wide foot. |||1
I've been a Merrell fan for a long time. These shoes are not only stylish but extremely comfortable. I highly recommend these shoes. |||1
I've worn these shoes for years. Thy've been VERY kind to my feet. The medium width is a good B size. I bought my husband a pair of white ones |||1
last summer, which--miracles never cease--he's still wearing. They're the only ones I've seen that are wide enough for him (He wears the XW.) These shoes are good for walking and |||1
playing tennis. I also wear an old pair to workout in the gym. |||1
hard to find 13 wide shoes. still..these will do. bought a pair a few years ago and the qualityseemed better. |||1
I purchased a similar shoe a couple years ago. This particular pair of shoes is a shiny leather that looks the same in every other way. I'm not sure if |||1
this is the same as what I bought previously, but it seemed like it would be from the pictures. Anyway, the shiny leather squeaks a little while I walk. The |||1
sound seems to be going away over time, but it is a little annoying at first |||1
KSwiss Classic Luxury sneakers are one of the most comfortable sneakers there are, especially for being as simple, less bulky as they are.On the inside, they are very cushiony, especially |||1
the sole. My husband wanted a simple, comfortable, black sneaker to wear when he does security work now and then "on the side." He needed something that would be good |||1
for standing/walking long 12 hr nights and did not want something too expensive as he only does this a few times a year, for certain events. These sneakers fit the |||1
bill perfectly and were our first choice since they fit every aspect we were looking for.They are simple, but look great with anything. I have been wearing them myself for |||1
decades, but this was my husband's first pair. He was very happy with them. |||1
Shoes fit great, true to size and probably one of the lowest prices I found, with the exception of used shoes on E-bay. |||1
Just what my husband was looking for. He only likes solid white casual shoes besides his track shoes for work outs in the NG. They fit true to size. |||1
The mistake was on my part. I thought I hit 10 instead of 9. Returns are always a problem. Gave to friend who wears 9. They said K-Swiss is not |||1
like older K-Swiss. Got cheaper with material and fit too snug. |||1
I would recomend these shoes to anyone.A little more narrow in the toes that the other pair I have.But look great! I really like K-Swiss shoes ! |||1
It is just what I wanted to replace the old pairs. Goes well with everything and great price. True to size. |||1
For me this is a perfect fit and oh so easy on the old feet. It was sized correctly and looks exactly as I wanted it. To go on would |||1
be redundant. |||1
Cant really go wrong with K Swiss , have worn them before and love them. Dont typically buy black shoes but had to have them for work. Only thing I |||1
would suggest if you have not worn K Swiss before is to maybe try on at a store before ordering online. They run small- you will probably need 1 to |||1
1 1/2 size larger than you normally wear. |||1
The size is not true. I bought a pair of 6 1/2 about two years ago from a different website and they fits perfectly. So I bought the 6 1/2 |||1
again. But they are at least two sizes larger. I have to return the shoes. I am not sure what happened. Did they do it on purpose so people think |||1
they have small feet or was it a mistake? |||1
This is the 3rd pair of K-Swiss sneakers I have purchased, because I love them so much!!! I love the way they fit on my feet, and how they're so |||1
soft and cushiony inside. They are also a very light tennis shoe. My sister-in-law looked at them and thought they'd be really heavy, so I handed her one, and she |||1
couldn't believe how light it was!!! |||1
After laughing the whole way home from the mall after seeing what looked like clown shoes for $150 or more I was glad to find these on Amazon. Ok, I |||1
admit I'm in my mid forties but I'm sorry the multicolored goofball shoes I saw didn't impress me much, they just look ridiculous. These however have a simple clean look |||1
and are some of the best fitting athletic shoes I've ever owned. I like a snug fit and these fit like a glove. You might not be the gym peacock |||1
but your workout won't suffer. |||1
I always look at construction,fit,appearance and price when I buy athletic shoes.I am not of the new school when it comes to this type of shoe.The persons name on it |||1
makes zero difference to me,plus it only adds to the cost in order to pay the endorsee.This shoe is the best in my view.I currently own 2 pair.They are comfortable |||1
and well constructed.I will keep buying them as long as K-Swiss keeps making them |||1
My husband loves these hard to find tennis! Thanks amazon for having them so I can easily shop! They are the most comfortable shoes. |||1
Have not had a pair of K-Swiss since the 80's. These look and feel great. Plus it's not the everybody is wearing it shoe like a Nike or Adidas well |||1
at least around here I have not seen anyone wearing them but I get compliments on them. A forgotten brand? I will look to them in the future when I |||1
make my next purchase. |||1
wow! K-Swiss men's ST329 Lace-Up sneaker all White, I love and fit well and are comfortable and I will also get the Brown ones to wear and glad I did |||1
get them and I would recommend these sneaker to anyone. 100% please |||1
I really like this shoes and the moment I saw this I had to own it, K-Swiss makes a great shoes |||1
Wonderful fit! Very light and comfy. My husband is very picky about his shoes and he really enjoys wearing these. If he's happy, I'm happy. They look very nice as |||1
well. |||1
This is a required shoe for my nursing program. I am happy with Q-Swiss quality and size. These shoes will hold up to Clinical duty. |||1
Essentially as expected. I have used them now about half-dozen times, and find them comfortable for court play, and at this time, appear that they will hold-up well, and will |||1
not wear-out prematurely. |||1
K-Swiss is a must have for one of my sons. He reports great fit, perfect for running as well as working out at the gym.These are stylish enough to wear |||1
most anywhere not just for fitness training. |||1
they looked good but weren't nearly as comfortable as i was expecting. i ended up returning them. shoes need to be comfortable! if you want a comfortable shoe, i'd go |||1
with the sketcher go-walks. they don't look quite as sharp but are super comfortable. great price, too. |||1
The shoes came fast. that why I like this company. everything was just right and my baby girl love them............ |||1
My husband is a fan of these and so am I. Since my son has been able to wear hard-bottom tennis shoes, we have purchased several pair and have never |||1
been disappointed. |||1
YEP LOVE THESE! Look small but are true to size when put them on the childs foot. LOVE THEM. These are perfecto! |||1
have always liked kswiss for myself. however, not the best for small kids. they are quite stiff and scuff so easily. and i'm not saying "gets dirty", I'm saying the |||1
leather on the front toes have totally been rubbed off after only a handful of wears. I think I'm going to have to stick to white Vans for now. |||1
I purchased this shoe for my 2 year old daughter. It is extra cute and extra durable. Best of all, I didn't even have to leave my home to get |||1
them! I am officially an amazon junkie! |||1
I bought these in a size 6 1/2 when my daughter was wearing size 6. I find that Reebok, Nike, & K-Swiss run a half size smaller or tend to |||1
be a little narrower than other tennis shoes. If a 6W was available, I would've ordered those instead. Also, they are nice shoes but the shoes strings are to get |||1
out and clean. |||1
These shoes.... ugh. They are so cute. And the quality is great. And they fit awesome. And they don't come off easily. I regret this purchase 0%!!!!! Love them. |||1
I rodered this shoe in a 5.5w BIG GIRL and recieved and baby shoe the shoes looks like picture defintely and im sure you have seen it before however i |||1
was not able to return and get proper size at deal price. |||1
My son needed shoes for his first soccer class and tennis shoes were suggested as an alternative to cleats. These seem comfortable and very durable. |||1
Love the shoe and love K-Swiss but the shoe was too small so we had to order a larger size and rush it so he could have it in time. |||1
The quality is still the same as I remember it. Unfortunately the sneaker does not run narrow andd the medium is just to wide. Disappointed skinny feet. |||1
Not sure if these are real but cute. I purchased wide width and they are not wide. So beware of that. They fit my sons feet which are a medium |||1
width |||1
Love these shoes. My son has a wide foot and they fit great! Dad has a pair and the two dress alike. Great shoe for a great price. So glad |||1
I caught them at $20.99. I see that they have gone up in price! |||1
Ripped in one wearing. LOW QUALITY |||1
My tot loves supers. I bought this big on purpose so I really can't testify to the size but its been peed in and washed a few times and is |||1
still going strong. |||1
This was purchased for my 4 year old to wear when we took him to see the new Superman movie. The quality is what you would expect from a packaged |||1
halloween costume that is meant to be worn for one day. The S on the chest started peeling on one corner after a few days of wear. My son is |||1
obsessed with super heros so he wears this costume around the house almost daily. The stitching for the velcro on the belt came loose and had to be repaired. For |||1
the price I paid for this, we have got our money's worth out if it. |||1
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson and he couldn't have been happier! I picked this one because it isn't padded in the chest. I wanted the costume |||1
to be comfortable since my grandson likes to wear his costume day and night. I actually ordered both the medium and the small. The sizing on the package of the |||1
small said ages 3-4. That made me uncertain if it would fit since my grandson is tall for his age. Just to be safe I ordered the medium too. It |||1
turned out the small was a perfect fit with room to grow so I returned the medium which was too big. If your child loves to dress up, I'm sure |||1
this will be a hit! |||1
As with some other reviewers, the belt and cape were separate. Maybe different styles of the same costume and the one you get depends on which year's model Amazon grabs |||1
out of the bin? Either way - grandson loves it! I bought a small and was surprised to find it fits both the 3.5 and the 5.5 year olds - |||1
one loose and one tight!Seems to be good quality - especially for a kids halloween costume. |||1
my grandson loved his outfit but he's a big boy and even though he was running around getting wedgies , he would not take the outfit off and all that |||1
really matters is that he loves loves loves it. |||1
We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it. This was perfect. My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, |||1
he can wear it to play in for a good year or so. He'll get lots of wear out of this. It would be nice if the boot covers fit |||1
tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you |||1
want. |||1
This product is perfect for a little guy who wants to be a super hero. The description was right on. And the price was good. |||1
If I could give it zero stars I would. Not only was it HUGE. The body would fit my three year old....but the legs would fit my 9 year old. |||1
Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume. This showed up without a cape and was a "Super Hero" suit. The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted |||1
on with bad paint that peeled off, and were not even straight lines. Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by. |||1
Takes about one week to break it in, I ordered the XXL for my hubby who normally wears an 11, he likes his flip flops to have some room at |||1
the ends, he loves these after they broke in |||1
Ended up giving them to a friend (no, I never wore them, just tried them on). Only come in S, M, and L sizes. I wear an 8.5 shoe and |||1
I fell between the S and M. Neither fit just right. Wish they made more sizes |||1
Only reason I bought another pair is because my OG's fell off a boat. Simple, and quality sandal. Not the cheapest but I will stick with them until they dissapoint. |||1
My first pair of Rainbows lasted me 4 years of very heavy wear. I could have worn them for another 2. These are great, and I love them. The heel |||1
is the only part that wears down at all, but it takes a really long time. I probably wore my first pair of these for 14 months daily (over 4 |||1
years). |||1
Easily my favorite sandals I've ever owned. I've had them for almost three years now, and I still wear them and they haven't worn out yet. I would definitely buy |||1
them again. The only thing you need to know is that those run a little smaller than usual. My shoes size usually is a 10.5-11 depending on the brand and |||1
the 9.5-10.5 fits perfectly. It was a little hard to get used to it in the beginning since it molds to one's feet, but as soon as that happened, it |||1
was the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever owned! |||1
He used my account to buy this, I think he is liking his new sandals. It seems to me well fitting to my brother. |||1
HEre's the thing....everyone says these sandals need a "break-in" period --- a) that's ridiculous, and b) they absolutely DO NOT fit a wide foot (E, EEE, or EEEEE). These are |||1
soft leather, nice looking and for a thin foot probably very comfortable. I wear a 7.5 EEE. I ordered one size larger (8.5 - 9.5 MEdium) and they absolutely DO |||1
NOT fit -- while you can get your foot into the strap, they cut into the skin between the toes, and there is absolutely no way to "break in" the |||1
sandle....I wore them for about an hour and found that a) not only do they not loosen up in any way they also dug into the top of my foot |||1
and created bloody welts. These 50.00 sandals became unreturnable because they have been worn, and they have dirt on them, and they have blood on the straps.$50.00 worth of garbage |||1
within one hour. DO NOT BELIEVE all these folks on here who say "just break them in"....they do not fit a wide foot, period. Save your money. |||1
These sandals last longer than any I've ever owned, which is why I keep buying them. The leather is soft and pliable and molds to your feet after about 10-15 |||1
wears. They survive through water and sand and heat and sun. Love 'em! |||1
So I lusted after Rainbows for about 7 years before I decided they might be worth the money.-I got a large (I wear 9.5M) and my foot went right to |||1
the edge, so I got an extra-large.-The wear in period wasn't so bad, I did get a blister as expected.-My largest problem is that the foot surface area got so |||1
smooth that my foot kep sliding in and out of the shoe, and it dried out and rubbed up against my foot. I feel like it was polishing the bottom |||1
of my foot.-I feel like they are going to fall off when I walk-I thought there was going to be a bit more arch support.-The bottom is very hard.All in |||1
all they are good looking sandals, but I've tried on a friend's REEFs and they were incredibly comfortable. If I could go back in time, I would have gone with |||1
the REEFs. |||1
these are so cool I'm so glad i can wear these and be cool like a surfer even though i live in the central valley |||1
If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80's and 90's, this is not it. The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn |||1
for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area. Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the |||1
heel area is too large, but the length was right. I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable. |||1
Will not be ordering these shoes anymore. |||1
Since this is a christmas present I won't be able to give a review of the product. I have been wearing this brand of shoe for 20 years and love |||1
it. |||1
I wear these with jeans. Cute shoes! |||1
I've worn Reebok Women's Freestyle Hi Tops for years, when I needed new ones recently, I went to several local stores at the mall only to find they didn't haven |||1
any and "hadn't seen them in a while". So, went to trusty Amazon.com and found them with ease. These are the only shoes I can wear that don't hurt my |||1
feet and that have good ankle support. The fit is great, they don't wear out. Good quality workmanship. |||1
Just like FloRida says "Reeboks with the straps." Can't beat them for comfort and support when on your feet all day. So far so good. |||1
I have a friend who feet kill her she wanted these so order them for her so far they have work like a dream.. |||1
These are very comfortable for zumba. The low tread works on all floors and the hightop is good for no rolling your ankle. |||1
I had a pair of Reebok Hi-Top sneakers years ago and wore them to threads. I hadn't seen any locally and had basically given up, until stumbling upon them on |||1
Amazon. I was delighted to get another pair.I remembered, and I'm glad I did, that these shoes run on the small and narrow side. I normally wear a size 9, |||1
but went up a half size to 9.5. And, they fit perfectly, with room for a light, gel type orthopedic insert, which I think is necessary because the footbed is |||1
not very cushioned. There is moderate arch support.I know many younger folks like Hi-Tops as a fashion statement. I really like them for the ankle support, particularly with this shoe |||1
because the double velcro straps provide for necessary adjustments for perfect comfort.These shoes are a blast from the past. I may have to spring for a pair in black for |||1
the upcoming fall/winter. |||1
I use to love these in the '80's but hi-tops became obsolete. Glad I could find some because in the hot summer I hate wearing my ankle braces as they |||1
make my feet sweat too much and constrict my blood flow making my feet and ankles swell. Anyway, although I haven't worn these out of the house yet, I'm sure |||1
they will work well for me provided I still use my cane. I will admit in reading the other reviews, they do run narrow which was fine with me and |||1
the length was perfect. Nicely made too. |||1
First time I had this model was in 1983. Bought them in Miami, saw them on top athletes. I loved them then and I love them now. Thank you. |||1
I have weak ankles, and decided that I needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support. Years ago, I wore Reeboks exclusively, in many different styles, and |||1
never had any problems with sizing. I had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow, but I figured that I would try them anyhow.The shoes |||1
arrived yesterday. I liked the sneaker, and the way that they were made. Problem was, that after just one look, I knew that they were not for me. They weren't |||1
a little narrow, but so narrow that it was obvious, to the naked eye, that these sneakers would not fit. I tried one on, and was just about able to |||1
squeeze my foot into them. Walk in them, forget it.There way no way that I could wear them. Some people had suggested buying a larger size, but I was afraid |||1
that it would not work. They still would be narrow, and too long.I have looked all over the internet, for a basic, white hightop, at a reasonable price. Apparently anything |||1
that I have seen are either very expensive, or come in garish colors only. Any suggestions? |||1
I've been wearing this type of shoe since the mid eighties. I don't recommend them for the gym, they are not made for it.But they are still so cute!Thank you. |||1
I'm a 5'9 dude and about 180 lbs and normally wear a large in jackets and coats. Not this baby. I ordered the large and it sort of dwarfed me. |||1
I'm not giving it only 3 stars for that reason however, but rather for the overall rough feeling material that the jacket is made of. The label says "Made in |||1
Mexico of US Fabrics" but not sure what fabrics they were actually using, definitely not something that is going to be taken care of in a few washings. If you |||1
want a rough and tough jacket where comfort is not an issue, then this might be the right one for you- but if you are looking for a casual outdoors |||1
type jacket that isn't stiff or uncomfortable, keep shopping. |||1
This jacket is warm in the winter and very rugged and will last many years under heavy use (construction).This jacket is very stiff and can be restrictive. The back of |||1
this longer below waist line jacket can ride up after driving and create folds in the back.I had a shorter length Carhart with stretch strip material at the bottom and |||1
built in hood. It didnt look as good as this one but it was much more comfortable after being washed several times and lasted years with heavy use.If you buy |||1
this jacket, wash it first thing to loosen it up a little bit.I strongly recommend Carhart clothing, but there is compromise with comfort for long wear and warmth.My recommendation is |||1
this jacket below:http://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-Mens-Duck-Active-Thermal-Lined/dp/B002WLOK1U/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qlEnable;=1&qid;=1284079028&sr;=1-16 |||1
I gave this to my fiance as a birthday present, i love Cahartt and i have other products from them. We live in Boston, so the jacket is very warm |||1
and fits its purpose, the only problem is that is very, very big, i think i got him the medium one and it fits like a large one, it's very |||1
bulky too, but as i said, if you are looking for something warm, go for this one but maybe a size less.Nice color and it's cool that it has inside |||1
pockets, at least that's what my fiance says :) |||1
Warm and Sturdy. I have only had this coat for a couple of weeks, but it appears to be living up to all the good reviews. Very warm and very |||1
well made (in Mexico). I fully expect to use this jacket all the time because it is warm and fashionable enough and should be able to handle anything I can |||1
put it through. I am looking forward to breaking this coat in over the next few months but am very confident I made the right choice. For sizing: I am |||1
almost 5'8" and the medium came about 2 inches below my waiste aind is plenty big to wear clothing underneath. However, again, the coat is so warm, I am wearing |||1
T-shirts in sub 40 degree weather with the coat on - even on windy days. |||1
Excellent Quality...don't try to improve it! My husband hates plastic zippers that's why he bought Carhart. This is a sturdy jacket for sturdy work! |||1
I got this for the boyfriend because he needed a good work coat, and he loves it. It seems to be very well made and very warm. |||1
this coat can be worn in the field or to a meeting at the office.... it's good for the top floor of an open structure or the conference room or |||1
the shop.... keeps me VERY warm yet when unzipped is fine indoors.... GREAT BUY!.... the attachable hood stinks tho.... WAYYYYY TO SMALL! (see separate review) |||1
The Sandstone Traditional Arctic quilt coat is made of high quality-durable fabric. It is water resistant and extremely warm against harsh winter weather. I like how Carhartt sticks to their |||1
line of more casual style of clothing and not creating something shiny,fancy and bold. This coat will keep you warm enough, so that you will not have to dress in |||1
too many layers. Carhartt makes clothing for the hard-working man. This coat is what we call "A Man's Coat". |||1
I grew up on a farm (and am now 38), and still consider myself a farm kid. But back then, I grew up on a small farm and we didn't |||1
have enough money to buy good stuff like Carhartt jackets for us kids who grew out of them every year! I've kind of always wanted one, and finally got sick |||1
of Columbia jackets with fleece lining that fills me with static or other jackets that just don't last. So I researched and bought this one.Many of the reviews claim that |||1
it's warm enough to wear outside as your sole jacket during winter. This winter (2013) in Fargo has been nasty cold so far, with multiple days with 0 degrees F |||1
or lower as a daily high! Most of these cold days, I am wearing a sweater under this, and it does the trick for me going from vehicle to building |||1
and back, while keeping me comfortable while driving. I've also worn it for longer periods of time outside when it's cold and windy, with a sweatshirt under it, and it |||1
has performed very well. It cuts the wind better than I expected, so as long as you have a warmer layer under it, it really is warm enough.I am 6'3" |||1
tall, and about 190 pounds. I also have trouble finding jackets with long enough sleeves. I bought the Medium, Long, and it fits me perfectly!! This is the part I'm |||1
happiest about. Even with a sweatshirt under it, it's still big enough.It has lots of pockets. Another important thing for me is enough pockets to carry my wallet, cell phone, |||1
and sunglasses. It has 2 large inner chest pockets (one with a velcro top, another with a zipper), and I keep my wallet in the velcro one. It also has |||1
2 outer chest pockets, and I keep my smart phone in one of those, easily accessible, easy to hear if it rings.I am very happy with this jacket, and am |||1
looking forward to having it last me multiple Fargo winters!Edited 12/30/13:Just spent an hour and a half tailgating for a football game, at -5 degrees F. I wore a long |||1
sleeved dry-fit shirt, a sweatshirt, a jersey, and this jacket, and felt perfectly dressed. I was concerned about spending this much time outside at that temperature with this jacket, but |||1
again, with the right layers, it cut the wind nicely, and did the job as expected! |||1
My wife is pretty damned picky, but she sure as hell LOVED these socks I bought her...Because she walks around the house in SOX, I thought I'd take a risk.Like |||1
I said, she loves 'em! I bought some of the OTHER colors, too! |||1
I just received these socks yesterday. So I went for a long walk today. 5 miles out in the country. The socks felt great in my walking shoes. I had |||1
to kind of rush for the last 2 miles to get home for my son, so I put the speed on. The socks even felt good at a good clip. |||1
They are nice and soft and cushy, yet they do not feel bunchy in the shoes. Overall a great sock. I will try them with hiking boots as soon as |||1
I can. |||1
These are soooo comfortable, tried them on with some new hiking boots and I did not want to take them off. Cannot wait to travel to Costa Rica and try |||1
them in the forests. |||1
item is exactly as ordered and advertised; this is very heartening because lately I have returned many items ordered through amazon |||1
I started wearing these Thorlo Thick Cushion Hiking Socks a few years ago based on reviews and I am delighted. Since their sizing is more specific, the socks fit perfectly, |||1
not too big like most. There's no extra material bunching in my shoes. These are now the only socks I buy and wear them year round. They are not cheap |||1
but they last an amazingly long time. Worth the price! (But I did stock up during a sale!) |||1
I love how cushiony they are. I also purchased the Thorlo Unisex Combat Boot Overcalf Socks and wear them slouchy. I have washed them a lot and they have held |||1
their shape and look great. But I also don't wash my clothes in hot water. I have been wearing Thorlo socks for years and have never been disappointed. |||1
I was discussing survival techniques with an Army officer who recommended Thorlo socks for warmth. I bought some for that purpose, for power outages, cold Winter weather, etc., and never |||1
have wanted any other kind since. They last for years and I wear them every day, Winter and Summer, usually without shoes since I work from home, sometimes with shoes |||1
on 3-mile walks. These are everything I want in a sock. I highly recommend them.Be careful to choose the right color. |||1
I bought these for boots that are large on me. These thick socks do the job of filling out the footbed and keeping my toes warm. |||1
I bought two pairs of these to wear with my newly purchased Golden Retriever safety toed hiking boots. They are very soft & fit well. I got the medium in |||1
black and I wear I size 7. It has been cold and wet out here, so these are great to have right now. Very happy with my purchase and would |||1
buy again. |||1
I wear a 7.5-8 womens shoe and loved this while hiking. The heel reinforcements reach up to your ankle so that if you are wearing hiking boots with good ankle |||1
support, the sock will be stronger there, too. Great, and actually pretty cute.I shopped around a lot on Amazon and found the other stuff way too expensive. This was the |||1
best womens one I could find. |||1
I have been buying Thorlo socks for decades. I just bought several pairs of these in black and the Thorlo quality is every bit as good as they used to |||1
be. These socks are so comfortable, great in summer as well as winter and not just for hiking. These are wonderful for walking the city pavements but you have to |||1
have shoes that are roomy enough to fit these wonderfully plush padded absorbent socks. These are a treat for your feet! |||1
I've worn these about 4 times on hikes and walks. They are wonderful! I've always used smart wool and these are comparable. I have the regular green smartwools so these |||1
are much thicker. But nice in the cold! |||1
I bought this sock to wear with my rain boots in the winter. It has lots of cushion and I have had no blisters after wearing them long hours. This |||1
sock fits my foot well, but is not as binding as other Experian type Thorlos I have worn. The extra cushion on the bottom is really nice, and I have |||1
been wearing them around my house as a slipper sock. Only buy them if you have extra room in your shoe. |||1
I couldn't be happier with this sock. It is just so comfortable and the quality is just so high. Never say no to this until you actually try it. It |||1
worths the full retail price. Now I know how socks should be made. I would highly recommend this. |||1
I wear these socks for every day, versus hiking, and they are perfect. They are not too thick for regular wear, but enough cushioning in the right places to feel |||1
good.I ordered the socks in Women's Small. According to the cardboard packaging, this should fit shoe size:US(W).. 5.0 - 6.5UK .... 3.5 - 5.0EU .... 36.0 - 38.0My shoe size |||1
is 6 Wide and these socks just fit nicely. |||1
I have thrown out all my old socks and replaced with these Thorlo women's thick cushion hiking sock.I have a farm and am in boots all the time. |||1
I bought these to go snowshoeing in and they worked very well. At the end of the day my feet were warm, dry and comfortable. They just feel really nice |||1
to put on. |||1
This sock is very thick and was a close fit into my hiking shoes. This brand has good support for the foot and ankle and feels really cozy on. |||1
These socks are great. They're are very comfortable. I know these are advertised for hiking, but I have worn them with 2 inch heeled boots before and they're great. My |||1
feet would normally start hurting after walking for a long time in those boots, but with these socks on, my feet don't hurt at all. It's amazing. These socks really |||1
do what they say they do. I would order another pair. |||1
The nape, though comfortable, lasts only one wearing before it is all pulled. Nice feeling but last only 1 or 2 wears, which isn't good. It is hard to find |||1
a good compromise between soft and durable. |||1
The wife went for an Mt Everest Base Camp trek, from Lukla to EBC and back to Lukla- 11 days. The problem was the weight allowed was only 8KG (about |||1
17 lbs) for the porters carry, therefore even extra pairs of socks were a bad item to haul. She carried 4 pairs of these socks and they did an amazing |||1
job of keeping her feet clear of all the sweat and ensured that she suffered no blisters doing about 8-9 hours of walking at that altitude.She wears shoes- Timberlands 7.5M |||1
and Reeboks US 9.5- probably due to the differences in widths. These socks fit upto US 9.5 for men perfect, and if you are 10+ then these may not be |||1
for you.All in all, she recommends this for any prolonged wear and for closed shoes, unlike track/sports shoes, where ventilation could be in issue. Absolute recommended buy. |||1
If you are on the higher end of the size range, id go up. Otherwise, they are so comfortable!!!! I really like them so far except they are snug in |||1
my toe area. hoping a stretch and line dry will fix that |||1
thorlo socks are wonderful ,I own a lot of them. they last for yearsif taken care of, so I wash on permapress and hang to dry, just takes a night. |||1
BEST ADVICE, BUY AT LEAST TWO PAIRS AT TIME. |||1
They are very comfortable socks which I wear under my boots in the winter. They are socks that fit me well. |||1
I've had these for 2 years and have worn them hiking and walking all over the city again and again and again - they keep me warm and are still |||1
as good as new. I'll definitely keep buying them. |||1
Women's size 11 shoe size here (Men's 9 1/2) and I ordered the large. Could not be happier! I love the padding, and the comfort in terms of temperature and |||1
moisture. I have a foot injury, and I need support and cushioning for my toes and the ball of my foot- these socks are perfect. They are very thick- so |||1
make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat, these should not give you any trouble, and at least for my shoe size, the fit was perfection. |||1
I thought this product would be softer under foot, but it feels a bit rough. The color is good as it is impossible to find thicker blue socks. All in |||1
all this product is okay for me - might be better for you. |||1
I wear a size 8 women's shoe and the socks fit perfect. The cushioning of the sole are perfect and help make walking comfortable. They are also quite warm and |||1
great for cold weather. I highly recommend them. |||1
Perfect fit, true to size, very comfortable and good for hiking. Also do not sweat too much work perfectly with my hiking shoes. |||1
I have no complaints. This sock has been fine for hiking. I did lots of backpacking during the summer. Works well. |||1
This is a good sock if you have thin calves. It was a bit tight on my calves, which are not large. I was disappointment that the sock wasn't thicker |||1
though, which made it less comfortable to walk in for a long time, and won't keep my feet warm in the snow.If you want a thick, warm, and cushioned sock, |||1
check out Thorlo Women's Thick Cushion Hiking Sock. Those socks are much better and not very much more money. |||1
great for someone on your feet. if you work on your feet these are great. fit well. nice thick cushions good for a day of strong movement. |||1
I usually just wear running socks, but decided to get these socks because we were going to be hiking in the mountains. I opted for Thorlo's because I have had |||1
great luck with them in the past - these did not disappoint. They work great and feel great. Keep in mind that these are thicker socks, so if your shoes |||1
run on the smaller size, these may not work. |||1
Very comfortable with good support and great colors. Wash and wear well and have already ordered a few more in pink! |||1
These cushion my feet and they stay up. They also keep my fit warm. The sock is thick and won't fit into snug shoes which was to be expected. The |||1
work great in my regular shoes and hiking shoes. |||1
I usually wear a 35x30 so I went with a 36x30 and there to small in the waist I recommend going a couple sizes larger in the waist. The length |||1
was fine. |||1
They feel very well made and they fit well. Loose but not baggy. Have worn thermals underneath and they don't feel tight. I pick up the black in 36x32. I |||1
am now looking to pick up another pair in the brown. Highly recommend. |||1
Pretty much every construction worker seems to own a pair of these, in classic Carhartt brown. Every semi-feral hobo kid seems to have these, or the overalls, or the double-fronted |||1
ones in black (to hide the dirt.) I wear them because they're the hardest-wearing, most comfortable work pants for the money, very close to the gold standard (Duluth Trading Company |||1
edges them out on quality by half a notch, but their stuff costs more.)Not only do the pants last longer than the GAP and Dockers pants, they also meet most |||1
peoples' contemporary standards of casual attire, and don't look out of place with a polo or Oxford shirt. Once broken-in, they're quite comfortable, with a loose but not baggy cut |||1
that can fit over a pair of long johns without chafing in cold weather. They've made jeans obsolete in my wardrobe, being tougher and much better-looking street clothes. Good stuff--buy |||1
a pair if you haven't already. |||1
Great pants to wear while working in the yard or to stay warm on snowy days. Nice heavy thick material. |||1
We've bought these time and time again because they're such a great buy. They last a very long time due to the type of fabric and they fit great. My |||1
brother has asked for a new pair every Christmas for the past few years because he loves them so much! |||1
These pants fit just great. Not too tight as to restrict movement, but not overly baggy or anything. They seem very durable. |||1
These pants come so close to being perfect! The fit and color were accurate and true to amazon's descriptions. They are stiff at first, almost like wearing a new burlap |||1
bag. A few washes later and they're getting much better. If you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle's creases it leaves faint |||1
white marks. I have no idea what these are, but they are unsightly. They also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to |||1
the knee, they it looks baggy. My biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets. Aren't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens? None of the pockets |||1
have any buttons or even velcro. I spend a nervous day in downtown New York City constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone hadn't slipped out. |||1
Other than that, I love them. They are constructed like Fort Knox. The crotch definitely isn't going to split anytime soon. I can see these lasting for years. |||1
I bought these for my husband and they are indestructible! He's been wearing them for years. The only bad thing about them, is that they do fade, but not near |||1
as bad as other brands of work pants! |||1
My son is rough and tough, with an athletic build! We originally purchased his Carhart pants for hunting. However, he wears them to school, in the snow and for all |||1
his outdoor activities. He started something, because a lot of boys are wearing them to school now. No matter how much dirt he piles on, they aways come clean. |||1
my husband works construction and the double knee + heavy weight prevents me from having to mend pants all weekend long |||1
Got the canvas pant as well and Grandson was so pleased. These are a little stiffer, but quality is unmistakable! He will be wearing these forever! |||1
good pants, just a bit over priced in my opinion. if they last for a while then I suppose that warrants the price |||1
These pants are well made, are comfortable but smart, and have that feel of quality which makes you feel good. |||1
I work at an Auto Parts store, and these are perfect for that type of environment.... as I am always on the move, and constantly have to either squat down, |||1
or move up a ladder. These are not only comfortable, they put up to the strain of a fast-paced work environment |||1
carhartt mean quality. plain and simple.i only wear carhartt pants and shorts. nothing else. you simply can't beat the durability and comfort. |||1
Ordered two pairs, same size. First pair fits with plenty of room, second pair I can't even button and they're too short. Both say the waist is a 33... Looks |||1
like more people are having this problem, likely has something to do with the quality control of their new outsourced plant. Won't be buying these off Amazon anymore, seeing as |||1
the size is basically a complete guess. Would recommend buying them in store where you can try on the pants first to make sure they fit. Waited too long and |||1
now I can't return them. Great pants, just wish they'd fit. This is the second time I've been disappointed with Carhartt in the last two months. |||1
I got these for my husband who is a general contractor. He usually rips the regular pants in 2 or 3 wearings. I will see how long he keeps these. |||1
He likes the fit and it appears to be durable. The fabric looks really strong. I have since ordered 2 more pairs in different colors. Thank you. |||1
Like all Carhartt products, these pants are extremely well made, they fit well, are comfortable and look great. High quality at a reasonable price! |||1
Light weight, durable, true to size, and they look great on my husband. Men cannot go wrong with Carhartt brand clothing. |||1
These are the most comfortable pieces of clothing I wear. After the third or fourth time I wore them, unreal fit. Just amazing. |||1
Great pants. I own 3 pair. Good fit, comfortable, and tough. Just what you'd expect from Carhartt. Spend the money |||1
These are good, quality pants perfect for outdoor hiking. They hold up to snags on vegetation and stay dry pretty easily. I did have some difficulty with maneuverability, but I |||1
am demand so this may be attributed to the fact that these pants are tailored for men. They have worked well for me and have good pockets and warmth. |||1
This is without a doubt the leader in the work pant world. You would be hard pressed to find anything that compares to Carhartt quality and value. Great selection of |||1
colors as well. |||1
I'm a Cabinetmaker with 35 years of experience. I've been wearing this type of Carhartt pants for years. They are very comfortable, have plenty of pockets for various tools and |||1
pencils, etc. They get excellent wear and run tru to size. |||1
I bought Carhartt work dungarees since I wanted durable pants I could use for snow blowing, cutting the grass, and doing other work around the house. I also am a |||1
teacher, so I need pants that will look good for me in school. These pants sure are just right for outdoor work and school. What I like is the back |||1
pockets are nice and large. My over-sized wallet fits perfectly. The front pockets are big enough and sturdy enough to hold everything you want to put inside. The other benefit |||1
is that since they are work dungarees, the pockets are designed to carry all sorts of items in them without getting holes in them.I am a physically larger person and |||1
these pants actually make me look good. They fit really well. The best part is that when you bend, stretch, or pick up something you aren't going to have a |||1
blow out on the side of the pants or in the crotch area. I just wish I had purchased these about ten years ago. There are also added side pockets |||1
for tools or whatever you want. The material is great and also the pants fit a bit loose, which I like. The material doesn't chafe you, but you can tell |||1
it can stand up to wear and tear. If you are a hard-on-clothing sort of person, then buy these pants. You won't regret it. |||1
The fit is slightly tight for my normal size, so maybe order 1 size up. They are very durable, but not all that comfortable. A lot of pet hair also |||1
clings to these. Looks strange walking around with tons of cat hair clinging tto your pants... have never had that issue before. (Plenty of shirts that do that, never pants.) |||1
Honestly I would recommend looking elsewhere, but they aren't terrible. |||1
When you look at the picture you think that they might be a distressed type of fabric but actually the colors are rock solid and the material isn't wrinkled. I |||1
wear these for work with a button down shirt and tie. While they are probably designed as work pants, they do very well for a contemporary dressy look. I'm on |||1
the heavy side and find these are very roomy. The tailor actually charged me extra for these pants, she said that the seams were triple sewn(or something like that).I've had |||1
these for around 6 months and they've held up very well. I send them to the dry-cleaner and so far minimal fading. |||1
Bought these pants as a gift for my son. The quality is very good and the price is excellent for carhart. |||1
kinda long for the size I ordered could be the bottom was a bit baggy on me and made the pants hang low. But other then the legs being too |||1
long for that reason there great pants. I wear a 50 32 must be the ass end was to baggy |||1
Carhartt pants are always very good, these pants are very heavy duty, don't see them wearing through any time soon. |||1
Size runs true, great fit, durable fabric, I have several pairs-will last a very long time! Pretty decent deal, would cost you at least $10 more in a local store. |||1
We purchases the product because they were 100% cotton. My husband likes the way they fit and how they wash. They are heavy so there will be a concern wearing |||1
them in the summer. |||1
On the one hand you get triple sewn seams but on the other hand, the duck cloth is pretty standard and not thick enough for daily hard wear and tear. |||1
A typical blue jean fabric is thicker than what you get here. I love these pants for general use but for construction work? I would give them 6 months max. |||1
They are a high quality product. I have older ones and knew what to expect and they didn't disappoint. Very comfortable |||1
This is a top end product and worth the money. They arrived on time and were neatly packed. The sizing was accurate along with the color. Good seller, good product. |||1
These pants are awesome but they run small and that's why I rated them with 4 stars instead of 5. If you are a big guy (I'm 6'4 275lbs) that |||1
likes to have room YOU MUST ORDER 2 SIZES BIGGER!! Trust me, save time by doing so but in the other hand if you are skinny w/ no behind then |||1
order your regular size or maybe 1 size bigger just to be comfortable. Overall I'm very happy with my pants after 2 returns. |||1
Every pair of pants fit differently however before you buy these keep in mind a dungaree fit means you will be wearing them like a rap star. Hanging off your |||1
bottom , and look ridiculous. Good quality material just get a pair of suspenders with them. |||1
the fabric is a little dry and not super soft. But it's stylish and comfortable. No complaints. A nice shirt that comes in perfect plus/tall sizes. |||1
Based on another customer's review I purchased a small size, where as I normally take a medium. This still fitted me like a large or extra large.I will wear it |||1
as an outer light weight jacket with the sleeves rolled up.I wouldn't purchase it again. |||1
A great shirt, cut for a full size man, wished they made bigger (when I was bigger) glad I fit in this, in fact it is a little big, or |||1
am I a little small, hope it's the latter |||1
If you order..make sure you order your exact size. It fits perfectly. Mediums some times run small. But it was a true medium. Great quality. |||1
This is a nice looking shirt I got for my husband! He says its comfy and he's tall and regular size fit perfect!! |||1
Shirt is 2xl and looks like it will fit well. color is nice and quality is usual for carhartt clothing |||1
No BS long sleeve. Fits like it should. Soft and great color. 6'3", 175 and I love the way it hangs. |||1
I now have all of the colors that I can get....I buy big and tall and don't see it shrink or stretch out (I lift the sleeves up my forearms) |||1
I work in the Desert and need to cover most of my arms and the salt from sweating gets all over...was and it is back to the same great feel. |||1
Carhartt makes products that last, this is durable, materials and workmanship went into the product. It is excellent for work. |||1
It's like the old saying "if you buy cheap, you buy twice" Carhart is quality no other way to put it. Just last night I ordered 2 more pairs of |||1
work pants and I know I will not be disappointed. I have this same shirt purchased 7 years ago and even though they show some wear are still doing the |||1
job each time I put them on. |||1
I love these shirts. Carhartts run about a 1/2 size larger than most shirts. Well built and comfortable. I love the three button collar, because I dont feel like I'm |||1
being chocked. They also look great for work or play. I plan on buying more. |||1
Good quality shirt ordered for a Christmas present for my son. He is rather tall and lanky. The shirt fits him well. |||1
Nicely made and looks very durable......I am happy with all the Carhartt purchases I have made....the prices are really not that out of line considering the quality. |||1
I like this shirt a lot. Fits great, made well. Good quality and is wearing nicely. I'll update in some months to share how it's holding up, but so far |||1
I love it.Carhartt! If you have any in my size laying around, feel free to send them on! I love this shirt. |||1
Comfortably light weight, yet warm enough for chilly days. The pocket allows for note cards and a pen. I use it when driving a student van. Easily layered with a |||1
T-shirt or a vest. |||1
I trust in Carhartt and wear their products to work everyday. These are perfect for cooler weather at work or on the lake. I plan to purchase more in the |||1
furture. Great product and very durable. You will get a ton of wear out of Carhartt products. Thanks Carhartt for creating multiple colors and to Amazon for carrying them. |||1
I love my Carhartt's shirts! These long sleeve T's are made of a durable material the is still soft and comfortable. I wear Carhartt's T's every day, whether long sleeve |||1
of short, they are great-fitting, high quality and long-lasting! |||1
Well made, nice material--more like a sweater. Got the "tall" so wouldn't pull out of pants if tucked in. Has a chest pocket because every shirt should have one for |||1
sunglasses etc. Arm length is great due to "tall" designation w/ribbed cuffs. Nice! |||1
I really enjoy the long sleeve pocket tee. The XLT size has a long enough tail that I don't worry about it coming out of my pants and it's heavy |||1
enough to act as a lower layer over my flannel on colder days. I also think it will work well for a summer shirt to protect my arms from overexposure. |||1
has them in every color. they get a work out and wash up nicely & last a long time. good quality & a handsome look for almost any body type |||1
Don't let the "Somewhat Large" fit bother you...I have not washed it yet, so I'm certain there will be a little shrinkage after that. What I love is that although |||1
this is not a "Tall", the sleeves are a perfect length for my 38" arms. Besides...I'm found that if I buy my clothes a little bit bigger than I need |||1
them to be...people are always complimenting me on my weight loss LOL! |||1
My husband loves these shirts. They fit great and are very good quality. It is about the only brand I buy for him any more. |||1
Heavy weight and warm. Washes great and I noticed in the first washing that the color stayed dark unlike other shirts that turn grey after numerous washes. |||1
Can't beat a Carhartt shirt! They fit well, wear well and last a long time. Don't hesitate, buy some now! |||1
Not my first Carhartt Work shirt, but first Henley with 3 button front. You can find work shirts for less, but this is a much better shirt, strong fabric double |||1
stitched - spend a few more $ and get the real deal with a Carhartt.Size; I'm just under 6' tall, 170 lbs 34" waist and sleeve length - athletic build; |||1
usually wear a large but a Medium Regular fits me best. I wear a basic cotton T-shirt under these.If you have a beer belly or chest measures larger than a |||1
42" regular suit a Large will probably be a better fit, also if you are going to wear over thermal shirt or sweater underneath go with the Large.I'm Carhartt brand |||1
loyal, I try to buy on sale, Henley was just over $20 so not much discount but Carhartt sells out - here on Amazon and in western wear stores - |||1
even if you pay full price you won't regret it. If the shirt fits buy it in every color! |||1
Thanks to the many other reviewers I ordered 1 SIZE SMALLER and it fits well. Well made of THICK 100% cotton.The material feels SCRATCHY until it's been washed many times |||1
even then it's a bit rough. If this is an outer shirt, no problem. |||1
Okay, I am 6'2 210 lbs and when I bought my last shirt like this a decade ago I purchased it at a local army / navy surplus store. It |||1
has lasted great and is getting thread bare :). I read the reviews before buying this one, I normally get XL in every shirt I buy but went with the |||1
Large after reading the reviews. I also will buy Longs when available but also opted out of that decision. This shirt fits perfect in the shoulders, the sleeves are plently |||1
long and so is the length. If it helps or matters mine was made in Honduras, I would have given this product a 5 star rating but is does not |||1
seem to be made with the same weighted material as my original that was made in the USA so long ago. Hope this helps ya all...... |||1
This is a very nice shirt. I have reordered it in the XL and will return this one because it is made much larger than the typical 2XL I buy. |||1
I bought this a gift. and it is just what I thought it would be. I love it. it is just right |||1
We are always pleased with the quality workmanship of carhartt clothing. I know that we will receive the same consistent quality product. I purchased these recently for my husband to |||1
take on a Outland hunting trip to South Dakota, he was warm and comfortable. |||1
Carhartt makes good shirts, they last long even though I wish they were made in USA I still buy them because the quality is never stinted on |||1
this shirt runs larger than its size states which when working hard makes this a very comfortable shirt to wear |||1
is quite right, the size is perfect, the quality excelenten, I bought 5 of this model and completely satisfied. totally recommended |||1
The work shirt is made well, it's durable and it washes well. It was very true to size, and fit him well. |||1
My husband loves these shirts. Short sleeved in warm weather and the long sleeved ones in the winter. Threy wear well and are very comfortable |||1
liked the fir and look |||1
He's not a tiny guy so this was perfect! Very heavy and is wearing well. Would definitely buy more in other colors. |||1
My husband is very satisfied with this shirt. He already had some he loved, they are warm and comfortable, wash really nicely and he wears them on weekends. |||1
It's been a long, cold winter here in the Northeast and I needed to add a couple of more thermal undershipts to my wardrobe.There are more expensive brands than Carhart |||1
and maybe they are more "fashionable". However, when it comes to keeping me warm and lasting for years, I've never found a better brand.If I do have one minor complaint |||1
it's that the sleeves are too long. Granted, I'm only 5'8", but the sleeves are long enough for guys playing in the NBA. |||1
Hubby wears these for cool fall days and for layering in the winter. He loves them and has one in every color.After washing and drying, the size medium is 22" |||1
across the chest, measured from armpit to armpit. They do fade a little but not too bad, just something to be aware of. |||1
this was too big for my hubby though he like the material but bad thing there were no XLT size so I returned this item. |||1
its a night gown, for me, if my husbands not wearing it. doesn't shrink, easy in /out of laundry, can iron and its a dressy casdual shirt |||1
TRUE TO FIT!!!GREAT SHIRT FOR ME!!!!-NOT HEAVY MATERIAL- A LITTLE MORE THICKER THAN T-SHIRT MATERIAL-HAVEN'T WASHED IT YET- I BUY SHIRTS LARGER TO ACCOUNT 4 SHIRIKAGE-I ALWAYS SHOP AMAZON!!!! |||1
The quality of the shirt is good and what I expected. I am 5' 9" tall and 160 pounds with a 34" sleeve length. I like a bit of extra |||1
room in my shirts for freedom of movement, especially long sleeve shirts. In a cotton shirt I usually buy a large knowing it will shrink down a bit with washing |||1
and drying. A lot of the other reviews indicated the sizes ran a little large so I ordered a medium.A medium ran true to size and certainly was not larger |||1
than normal. So I returned for a large and it was the perfect size for me- before washing/drying. I removed from the dryer while still slightly damp on the heavier |||1
material sections and it still shrunk some, about 1/2 of a size.For reference, my heather gray colored shirt was made in the Domican Republic and is 90% cotton and 10% |||1
polyester. Maybe I need to order a long and/or maybe a relaxed fit version. But these are too expensive to experiment with sizing and I have not found any locally |||1
I could try on. |||1
I work on a farm and this is a great shirt to wear under my other clothes, in layers. The shirt is long so it tucks in great. Keeps me |||1
very warm. |||1
Made to Carharttstandards, very comfortable.Product is made well and expect it to last. Highly recommend product to others. Great |||1
I originally ordered this in an XL because that's what I normally wear but it was HUGE, like a tent. So I sent it back and got a Large. It |||1
fits better but it is still a tad too big. However I wouldn't order a medium because that would likely be too small. Never had that problem with a shirt |||1
before, I don't think there would be a size that fits just right. |||1
My husband really liked the shirt but was disappointed that it was too big. He wears an XL and is just too big for him. The blue is not as |||1
bright as it is in the picture. |||1
Fits good, feels good, looks good. What more can I say, except to fill up words required on this review. Oh, yeah, sorry I did not buy two. |||1
These socks are lightweight, yet very cushiony. They make my feet feel great inside my hiking boots. I think they're especially good for older feet that are getting more sensitive |||1
in the heel area. |||1
These socks are absolutely amazing, and I cannot believe how much better my feet feel after long walks or workouts with wearing them. They make all of the difference in |||1
the world.I learned about the Cool Max sox from reading Leslie Sansone's book, and decided I should use all of the research that the US Army put into finding which |||1
socks held up well for soldiers in the field. These are for walking workouts, and have excellent cushioning just where you need it, plus they wick away moisture.Your feet will |||1
love you for getting these! |||1
These are the best fitting and most comfortable socks that I have ever worn. They cushion the feet where needed and do not shift or fall down. They launder very |||1
well. Well worth the price. I still have some socks from this company that are almost 20 years old! |||1
Have had a pair of these for 5 years, great for summer /office wear.I love thorlo, love smart wool, love great socks, work on my feet all day.BUT WATCH THE |||1
SIZING, 9 IS A 6!!!!ordered two pairs, now on my sisters feet!!!GET THE SIZING CHART.ADORE THESE SOCKS!!!! |||1
The sock fits well, but it doesn't stay up. The cushioning is very nice and makes the sock thick. I think it keeps my feet warm and not cool. I |||1
like to wear them around the house when my feet are tires because of the cushioning, but they aren't the summer hiking sock I wanted them to be. |||1
I tried buying tee shirts from the big makers, and they all arrived with thin fabric, even the ones that said thick fabric. Carhartt, on the other hand, makes tee |||1
shirts like they did 40 years ago, with nice thick fabric that you know will last for years. It's a relief to get a product that is made of really |||1
good material. Highly recommended. |||1
The shirt was a size to large. I'm 5'10" 200lbs and the lrg was too big. I recommend getting a size smaller then usual. The quality is great! |||1
I have found a new favorite brand! It's so difficult to find clothes that fit when you're big and tall (tall, dark and handsome if I do say so myself). |||1
I usually wear the same clothes every year until they wear out but now I have bought a new wardrobe, basically. I've spent $500 or so on Carhartt clothes in |||1
the past few months and I don't regret it. I wish they would make sweat pants!These are very thick material, really nice design. I don't mind the big logos like |||1
some people--I like how it adds extra color and style. These will last me for years, no doubt about it.Also, these are made very loose. I would say 1 size |||1
larger than most cheaper clothes. If I wear one of those generic clothes (which I don't mind wearing btw) I usually have to order like a 5X because they are |||1
so small. I definatley like a loose fit so it suits me perfectly. However, if you like your clothes to have a classic, tighter fit I would order a size |||1
smaller. Their hoodies are pretty true to size but their long and short sleeve tees I would for sure buy a size smaller.So yeah, these are way more expensive than |||1
I normally pay. There are t-shirts I can buy at the mall 5 for $20 but they have literally started falling apart just after one summer. So it's worth it |||1
to buy these because I know they will last.Awesome brand! If you're not sure then go ahead and buy it because I don't think you will be disappointed. |||1
The fit on these t-shirts are ludicrous. I ordered a small and what I received would be considered a large had I ordered it from Gap or Land's End. While |||1
I am by no means tiny, Carhartt's version of the venerable t-shirt is only a couple notches shy of a gown on my frame. You gotta be a big corn-fed |||1
American boy to sport one of these.Running it through the dryer made it worse; the neck hole shrank but the other dimensions remained almost unchanged. Even the pocket sits forlornly |||1
off to the side, as if seeking the shelter of my armpit. This is possibly the most awkward t-shirt I've ever bought. |||1
I bought these shirts for my husband for work. Material is good heavy weight cotton. I had to return them and exchange for one size smaller. They run quite large |||1
and did not shrink with washing. He likes them but wished the pocket had a separate place for his pen. |||1
Carhartt shirts and Dickies jeans have always been my favorites for comfort and durability at a price that is great for the quality and durability. I live, play, work and |||1
will probably die in a Carhartt. |||1
Nice shirt, as expected. Thicker than most t-shirts. I probably could have used a large but it may shrink a bit. I think it does run a little on the |||1
big side. Other than that great shirt. |||1
Nothing much to add to other positive reviews. These are good quality T-shirts of nice thick cotton knit. I usually buy oversize to allow for shrinkage of cotton knit fabric |||1
but it is not necessary with these shirts. They come oversize. It's best to wash them before wearing since they will fit huge until they shrink down in length and |||1
girth. It's also recommended that you wash the darker colors separately--at least at first. I hand washed all the T-shirts I ordered before wearing and the Port colored one turned |||1
the water in the sink red. Be careful until the excess color has washed out. I have noted overall fading with the older black Carhartt T-shirt I have. This is |||1
after several months of wear and washing.I've bought several of these shirts in various colors. They are head and shoulders better than the cheap T-shirts you can find at Target |||1
or Walmart although they are more expensive. They are comfortable for work wear and look nice under an unbuttoned sport shirt for casual get-togethers. I really like them, except for |||1
the fading issue I've noted with the darker colors. |||1
A T-shirt may be "only a T-shirt" to some, but when you want a roomy shirt with generous proportions and substantial materials -- the all-cotton shirt is a bit heftier |||1
than run-of-the-mill T's -- this Carhartt shirt does the job. The armholes allow easy motion, and the body of the tall-sized shirt is longer than the norm of tall sizes |||1
from other manufacturers. Both features ensure all-day comfort for the active wearer. This holds for work and play duties alike. The only quibble: There's a small, cheesy (cheap-looking) manufacturer label |||1
on the front of the breast pocket. There are a lot of other ways and places to put a brand's name on a garment. |||1
I ordered a few of these shirts for my husband. I ordered a large based off his other pocket tees by other brands (Hanes, etc) but it was too big. |||1
There was a 3 inch difference in width and about the same in length. Once I exchanged them for a Medium we were both very happy with the quality! |||1
It fits good, a little large which is what I wanted. A little inferior quality compared to shirts I bought about 4 years ago. |||1
My husband loves these Carhartt work shirts. They are long and hold up to the wear and tear. We bought these in 3 different colors. Definitely would recommend! |||1
Carhartt is a great brand for sweatshirts, which I own 3. I thought I would try their t-shirts and I wasn't disappointed. The first thing was the length was perfect |||1
for me. I am 6'1" and hate shirts that I can't tuck in because they are too short. LL Bean is a good example of being too short. Second the |||1
pocket is as well made as the shirt. Great product. |||1
I like Carhartt in general, and in fact it's my favorite brand of jeans. But this shirt was a disappointment.It was so scratchy when I opened it that I couldn't |||1
stand to wear it. I thought it might be from leftover sizing in the fabric, but it didn't get any better after washing. I even tried the "soak in brine" |||1
technique, which softened it a bit, but it's still scratchier than my other t-shirts. Four washings so far, and it's still scratchy, though it is getting a little better with |||1
each washing.I have other pocket t-shirts of comparable thickness from American Giant and Key. Both are much softer and more pleasant to wear than this one, even right out of |||1
the package.On the pro side, the fabric is thick, and the size is good. I've gotten medium t-shirts from department stores that shrank to uselessness after a few washings, but |||1
this one kept its size pretty well. I also like the color (I got Sand). If only it were more comfortable to wear.*** Update 6 August 2013 ***Nine washings now, |||1
and the problem is no better than after the fourth or fifth washing. It still feels prickly the moment I put it on, unlike any of my other t-shirts, including |||1
cheap department store ones.I looked at the fabric and it has a fair amount of pilling on the inside of the shirt. So it's pretty clear that the scratchiness is |||1
not going to get better. I'm ready to put this one in the grunge clothes bin. I'm guessing it was just a bad batch of cloth.They probably make these shirts |||1
in various locations. For reference, mine was made in the Dominican Republic. |||1
This is a great tee for the money, fabric is heavy and the shirt is well constructed. For me the shirt is a bit long, sizing seemed a bit smaller |||1
than I would prefer. |||1
High quality shirt worth the price I will buy more I got the Gray just washed it no shrinking ither |||1
Very nice and well made shirts! I bought several for my husband and he loves them! They wash nice and don't fade fast! |||1
These shirts do run big. I ordered an XL at first and it is WAY big on me, so I ordered a few more in a Large and they are |||1
great. |||1
The shirt seems to be very durable, and is thicker more dense material than your average T shirt.I ordered 2X, but I think I will order 1X next time. |||1
Great shirts, I use them for work & play. They last a long time and the neck does not get out of shape. |||1
My bf loves carhartt and t-shirts with pockets in the front so he loved this shirt we bought the bluestone color which he loves he will probably come back and |||1
buy a couple more of this same shirt in different colors I really liked the olive color also but he didnt buy it |||1
There are the heaviest and best work and all around pocket t shirts . I like I can get tall sizes that never show a plumbers crack and tuck in |||1
well keeping in warmth . The long sleeves ones are great to layer in winter . The material is almost as heavy as tent canvas but soft as it is |||1
cotton . They are generous to size but do order your regular one because air pockets are good insulators as well as aid in wicking moisture and drying . They |||1
shrink a tad . Carhartt's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do |||1
I will try other quality brands like Key's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt's are best . They stain less and the |||1
same goes for other wear and tear. I have found it is better to not use bleach when washing these .Good luck |||1
I love Carhartt T-shirts. They are oversized, usually with a longer tail to prevent "Plumbers Crack" for a man with a heavy belt on. They are very thick cotton, and |||1
