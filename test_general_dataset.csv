The "A Team" out today taking care of some Concrete Preps. It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you enjoy what you do and do it right the 1st time. I've had guys before that all they want to do is the easy, don't have to think, don't have to get out of the machine, don't have to worry about anything, just work the Machine type of guys, and those are the type that know everything, and have all of the experience in the world. Those are the guys that need to get out of the machine and show their knowledge on the ground, because if they don't have that then how are they going to do the job right and get it done in an efficient manner?? --Just super pumped to have Kick Ass Employees and a Foreman who know exactly how to do the work that we do day in and day out everyday!! --#rockstructures #rockstructuresutah #trimble #cat #308E #excavator #289D #skidsteer #work #concrete #prep #construction #henrywalkerhomes #daviscounty #webercounty #saltlakecity #instagood #instadaily @catproducts @wheelermachinery|||1

‚ÄúCities In Dust‚Äù This weekend while I was in the desert with some friends I realized something profound. Every visit to the wilderness teaches me something new, and this weekend I realized that in our every day lives, all of the sounds we hear are layered. The car motor, music, horns, traffic, the tv, etc. It‚Äôs all noise on top of noise on top of noise on top of noise. In the wild you get to hear individual sounds, uninterrupted and clear. This is something very few people ever get to experience. Listening to only the crackling of a campfire, or wind against the trees, or coyotes in the night, or the complete absence of sound all together. I‚Äôm so grateful I get to experience this on almost a daily basis, and this is something I know is important for me and I‚Äôm almost positive it is important for every human to experience. This is why we need to protect the little wilderness we have left. Silence, time, and space are becoming precious and finite resources, things we will soon all run out of because of the hustle and bustle of our enough is never enough, always need more, consumer culture that will soon consume every natural thing around us. #earthoffical #wow_planet #main_vision #ourplanetdaily #earthfocus #awesomeearth #natgeography #nakedplanet #fantastic_earth #igworldclub #discoverglobe #earthfever #master_gallery #ig_exquisite #igrefined #earthspirit #awesomedreamplaces #awesomeglobe #awesomepix #ig_bliss #cascadiaexplored #globeshotz #fantasic_earth #naturegeography #depthsofearth #gottolove_this #sunset_vision #utah #sunrise #desert|||0

Ivy is a friendly girl.  She was happy for attention and was very gentle.  She was surrendered due to the other pet.   Sigh.   Her notes state " Owner states this dog is friendly with people and children. Owner says Ivy has lived with their other dog Jade(older female) for a few years with no issues. However, in the last 2 months, Ivy has bitten Jade twice. The first incident was 2 months ago when Ivy was jealous of Jade getting attention. The 2nd incident happened today, the dogs were sitting next to each other getting treats, Ivy growled and bit Jade's ear causing minor punctures. Owner is surrendering because she cannottake chances of a person or child getting injured from the dogs fighting."  Ivy has been great at the shelter.  She passed her assessments.

Two years ago, Professor Jay Rosen of @NYUniversity gave a guest lecture at BYU. He wrote the following after his visit: ‚ÄúA most unusual thing happened before I was introduced. Unusual for me, normal at Brigham Young. Dale Cressman, who organized the event and guided me around campus, asked a student to begin the event with a prayer. The student stood and prayed for help in ‚Äúfeeling grateful for the opportunity to learn.‚Äù I wish more college students felt that way and expressed it as well as she did. I found the BYU students a joy to teach. They were extremely engaged. With good humor they tolerated me asking and re-asking them the same question ten times, answering in a slightly different way each time, which allowed me to make a new point in response. After the talk, at least a dozen of them thanked me, and each one shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and made a personal connection. ‚ÄúGrateful for the opportunity to learn‚Äù . . . that wasn‚Äôt just words to them. It was one of the best experiences I have had in 30 years as a professor.‚Äù PC: @ellieaphotography #BYU|||0

"Being happy üòÉ is a very personal thing and it really has nothing to do with anyone else." -Esther Hicks ‚Ä¢Does anyone else feel like this is a hard lesson to learn?! ü§î I think we often forget that happiness is OUR responsibility. Some of the most positive people I have met have come from difficult backgrounds. They are always an example to me and living proof that happiness is a personal choice. We can't point fingers üëâüèº at someone else for why we aren't happy, we also can't feel guilty when we do our best to make loved ones feel happy and they reject it. Our happiness...it‚Äôs on us, which is both frightening and liberating! ‚ù§Ô∏è http://liketk.it/2uDae #liketkit @liketoknow.it #inspiringquotes #motivationquotes #motivationtuesday|||0

It‚Äôs amazing no matter how hard you try to occupy your mind, or your time, that grief catches up with you and find yourself completely engulfed in the disparity..... I‚Äôve never missed Hayes so much than I have this past week. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had time to myself for the first time since he passed away.........It‚Äôs given me time to reflect back on my time with him and the short time I was given with him. It‚Äôs been 3 consecutive days where I have dreamed of him....... I dreamed I was holding him, playing with him as he was crawling around. I dreamed of his smile, the same smile that peered at me through his hospital crib as he received 6 rounds chemotherapy. Yet despite the joy of seeing him in my dreams.....It oddly awakened me to the reality of never being able to have that physical connection again. For the past 3 mornings my heart has felt the emptiness of not having him by my side as I woke up with a craving to physically feel him in my arms.  Leaving me with no other option but to channel that reality and be the best Dad I can be for Hayes‚Äô brothers and sisters. Being away from my kids has made it more evident just how much they have carried me through this past year without Hayes. Almost a complete dependency on them to move me forward in life. I maybe joke about the chaos and the tantrums and the ‚Äúvacations‚Äù at the gas station but I need them way more than they need me. And I am so grateful for them. #family #dadlife #hayestough #parenting #fatherhood #dadsofinstagram #dads|||0

@catherine.wigg posts are always speaking to my mama heart üíï ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to express gratitude to our children just for being who they are. Rarely do we thank them for who they are, yet we always want them to appreciate who we are. If we as parents took a moment to look our children in the eye and say, ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù really meaning it, their sense of their value would expand exponentially. In this way, we communicate that they have something to contribute just by being themselves.‚Äù - @drshefalitsabary The other day William didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlisten‚Äù and do what I was basically ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù he do. (My ego was fired up!)... and when I calmed down I genuinely applauded him for knowing who he is and NOT listening to me when it didn‚Äôt feel good. Sounds crazy, right? But really think about it... #consciousparenting #momlife #letthembelittle #family #gentleparenting|||0
